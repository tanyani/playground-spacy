Do HMOs Affect Educational
Disparities In Health Care?
ABSTRACT
BACKGROUND We wanted to examine how membership in a health maintenance
organization (HMO) is related to delivery of preventive clinical services to
patients with different educational levels.
METHODS We conducted a cross-sectional analysis of the 1996-1997 Community
Tracking Study Household Survey among adults aged 18 to 64 years with private
or Medicaid health insurance. We examined interactions between respondent
educational level and HMO membership for the following measures: having a
regular source of care and, in the past year, having had a physician visit, a men-
tal health visit, a mammogram (women  50 years), an influenza vaccination
(ages  55 years), or smoking cessation counseling (smokers).
RESULTS After adjustment for sociodemographic factors, community size, insur-
ance type, physical and mental health status, and smoking, respondents with less
education were significantly less likely to have had a physician visit or mental
health visit, mammogram, or influenza vaccination in the past year. Disparities in
receipt of preventive care by educational level were smaller among HMO mem-
bers. Differences in disparities between HMO members and non-HMO members
reached statistical significance for influenza vaccination and showed a trend for
mental health visits (P = .06). Moreover, HMO members with less than 12 years
of education received services at levels comparable to non-HMO members with
more education.
CONCLUSIONS There are appreciable disparities in receipt of preventive care by
education among nonelderly insured persons. HMO membership is associated
with smaller disparities for some services. Those with the lowest levels of educa-
tion appeared to benefit the most from HMO membership.

INTRODUCTION
The elimination of disparities in health and health care is a central
goal of Healthy People 2010.1 Socioeconomic status and race-eth-
nicity have been linked to standard measures of health care quality.
Lower socioeconomic status, often measured by years of education com-
pleted, is associated with receiving fewer Papanicolaou smears, mammo-
grams,2,3 influenza immunizations,4 and diabetic eye examinations,5 as well
as later enrollment in prenatal care6 and lower quality ambulatory7 and
hospital8 care.
Because of a population focus and greater reliance on performance assess-
ment, including accountability to accreditation organizations,9,10 health
maintenance organizations (HMOs) are potentially positioned to improve
health care to persons of low socioeconomic status and reduce disparities
among plan members. Yet relatively little is known about the quality of care
provided to persons of low socioeconomic status in HMOs or the impact of
HMOs on disparities. In earlier studies, Ware and colleagues11,12 found that
low-income, ill persons fared worse in HMOs than outside HMOs.

Others studies suggest that HMO membership has
little effect on racial and ethnic disparities in influenza
shots and health care utilization measures4,13 and
might be associated with greater barriers and lower
satisfaction for minorities.14
Using a large, nationally representative survey, we
compared delivery of preventive clinical services
among nonelderly adults enrolled in HMOs with those
in non-HMO health care plans. Because HMOs can
use population-level quality measures and educational
campaigns, we hypothesized that we would observe
smaller disparities in the delivery of these services by
educational level among HMO members.
METHODS
Data are from the Community Tracking Study (CTS)
Household Survey conducted in 1996 and 1997.15 It is
a telephone survey of 60,446 persons representing the
US housed, noninstitutionalized population. Sixty
communities were randomly selected using stratified
sampling with probability in proportion to population
size to ensure representation of the US population.
While random-digit dialing was used to select most
households, a small sample also included households
without telephones; these respondents were provided
cellular phones for the interviews. Survey data included
sociodemographic characteristics, health insurance,
health care utilization, health status, and preventive
health services. The number of elderly respondents
with Medicare who were enrolled in HMOs could not
be determined as a result of an error in the original
survey; analyses for this study were confined to adults
aged 18 to 64 years with insurance (private or Medi-
caid). The final response rate for the CTS Household
Survey was 65%. A total of 31,676 nonelderly adult
respondents comprised the sample for the study.
Regular source of care; likelihood of a physician
visit, mental health visit, mammogram, or influenza
vaccination in the past year; and receipt of smoking
cessation counseling were each modeled as a function
of HMO membership and patient educational level.
Interactions by insurance type were also modeled.
Covariates, described below, were selected using the
Andersen-Aday behavioral model that identifies predis-
posing, enabling, and need factors.16
Primary Independent Variables
Education (Predisposing). Data were collected regard-
ing respondents' education (less than 12 years of com-
pleted education, 12 years, 13-15 years and 16 or
more).
Insurance (enabling). This was classified as private or
Medicaid.
HMO membership (enabling). This was based on the
respondents' responses to a survey item asking whether
their plan was an HMO or not.
Covariates
Race, Ethnicity, Language (Predisposing). The fol-
lowing 5, mutually exclusive categories were based on
the respondent's self-identification and the language in
which the interview was conducted: white; black; His-
panic, English fluent; Hispanic, non-English fluent; and
other race.
Demographic characteristics (predisposing). These cate-
gories include age (18 to 29, 30 to 44, and 45 to 64
years, but entered as a continuous variable in analyses
of mammography and influenza vaccination, where the
sample was limited to older adults), sex, marital status
(married or not), family size, community size (large
metropolitan region of more than 200,000 population,
small metropolitan region of less than 200,000 popula-
tion, or nonmetropolitan region), and household
income (as a percentage of the federal poverty level
for 1996: less than 100%; 100% to 199%; 200% to
299%; 300% to 399%; more than 400%).
Health status (need). We used self-reported health sta-
tus as a proxy for need. Health status was assessed
based on the Medical Outcomes Study Short Form
12-item health survey (SF-12). It includes 2 summary
scores, 1 for physical health (range, 10 ­ 69; mean, 52
in this sample) and 1 for mental health (range, 8 - 71;
mean, 51 in this sample). It has been shown to be reli-
able and valid compared with the well-established,
longer SF-36.17,18
Smoking status (predisposing). Respondents were asked
whether they currently smoked, formerly smoked, or
never smoked.
Dependent Variables
We used standard dichotomous measures for medical,
mental health, and preventive health services use.
Having a Regular Source of Care. This variable
was dichotomous ("Is there a place you usually go when
you are sick, or need advice about your health?") This
measure was also included as an independent covariate
in analyses of the remaining dependent variables.
Physician Visit. This measure was based on a
respondent report of at least 1 physician visit in the
past year.
Mental Health Visit. This measure was based on
the respondents report that they had "seen or talked to
a mental health professional such as a psychiatrist, psy-
chologist, psychiatric nurse, or clinical social worker"
in the past year.
Mammography. Respondents were asked whether
they had received a mammogram in the past year

(women older than 50 years, n = 7,418 for this sub-
sample).
Influenza Vaccination. Respondents were asked
whether they had received an influenza vaccination in
the past year (adults 55 years and older, n = 4,277 for
this subsample).
Smoking Cessation Counseling. Respondents who
smoked were asked whether they had been counseled
by their physician to quit smoking (adult smokers,
n = 7,488 for this subsample).
Analysis
We conducted analyses using the statistical software
package SUDAAN19 to account for the complex
design of the CTS Household Survey.15 We compared
HMO and non-HMO members overall and within
each educational stratum.
Separate logistic regression models were developed
for having a usual source of care (all) and receipt in
the past year of at least 1 physician visit (all), at least
1 visit with a mental health professional (all), smoking
cessation counseling (all smokers), mammography
(women 50 years and older), and an influenza vaccina-
tion (all 55 years and older). We assessed for interac-
tion between HMO status and education and also
evaluated interactions between HMO status and
income, race and ethnicity, and Medicaid insurance.
To facilitate ease of interpretation of the size of the
education and HMO effects, adjusted predicted mar-
ginal effects were calculated.20
RESULTS
The characteristics of respondents in HMOs and not
in HMOs are shown in Table 1. In bivariate analyses,
HMO members were more likely to be younger, male,
single, minority, and more educated, have a higher
income, have private insurance as opposed to Medic-
aid, reside in a large metropolitan area, and have bet-
ter physical health status. Higher educational attain-
ment was significantly associated with greater likeli-
hood of having a usual source of care, a physician
visit, mental health visit, mammogram, and influenza
vaccination (Table 2). Adjustment resulted in loss of
significance for having a usual source of care but had
little effect on educational disparities for the other
measures. Statistically significant differences in the
likelihood of having a mental health visit in the last
year by educational level increased after adjustment.
Interestingly, there was no association of education
with receipt of smoking cessation advice.
Table 3 shows crude (bivariate) and adjusted associ-
ations of health care access and use with HMO mem-
bership. Following adjustment for race-ethnicity-lan-
guage, age, sex, income, marital status, family size,
community size, smoking and health status, HMO
members were more likely to have a usual source of
care, a physician visit, mammogram, and influenza
vaccination.
Significant interactions were found between HMO
status and educational attainment for influenza vacci-
nation and smoking; there was evidence of a trend

(P = .06) for mental health visits (Table 4). Educa-
tional disparities were narrowed for influenza vaccina-
tion and mental health visits within HMOs. For smok-
ing cessation counseling, HMO members with less
than 12 years of education were more likely to receive
counseling than persons with more than 16 years of
education. In contrast, there was little difference
among non-HMO members. A careful review of
Table 4 shows that in each instance, those with the
least education fared better if they were HMO mem-
bers. This effect was less consistent among those with
higher education. With the exception of having a
usual source of care and smoking cessation counseling;
however, persons with lower educational attainment
continued to fare worse than those with more educa-
tion even within HMOs.
There were few other statistically significant inter-
actions. Respondents with Medicaid HMO member-
ship had significantly higher likelihood of smoking
cessation counseling than respondents with Medicaid
in fee-for-service practices or respondents with private
HMO or non-HMO coverage. Notably, there were no
significant interactions between HMO membership
and race-ethnicity (including non-English-fluent His-
panics) for any of the health care utilization measures,
suggesting that HMO membership had no differential
effect on care for minorities. There was also no inter-
action between HMO membership and income.

patient educational attainment in use of health care.
Persons with less education were significantly less
likely to have had a physician or mental health visit, a
mammogram, or an influenza vaccination within the
last year. Consistent with previous studies,21-23 we
found that HMO membership was associated with an
overall beneficial effect on care. Most importantly,
those with the least education tended to show
improved use when in HMOs. In particular, HMO
members with less than 12 years of education received
services at levels comparable to non-HMO respon-
dents with more education. Disparities were signifi-
cantly smaller for influenza vaccination. The least
educated smokers enrolled in HMOs reported the
highest likelihood of smoking cessation counseling of
any group. In no instance were educational disparities
worse in HMOs.
To our knowledge, this study is first to examine
specifically the impact of HMOs on educational dis-
parities in health care utilization using nationally rep-
resentative data. Previously reported results showed an
absence of any apparent effect of HMOs on racial and
ethnic disparities4 and an apparently harmful effect on
health outcomes for ill persons of low socioeconomic
status.11-13 Our findings suggest that HMOs might
have modest beneficial effects on at least some educa-
tional disparities in care.
These findings should be tempered by the limita-
tions of the study. All data were based exclusively on
self-report. There is some inaccuracy in self report of
HMO membership; among privately insured persons
in the CTS Household Survey, self-report of HMO
membership had a sensitivity of 73% and specificity of
78%.24 Educational bias in reporting HMO member-
ship alone, however, could not account for these find-
ings. Only if educational bias in reporting HMO
membership were correlated with a bias in reporting
use of services would such a bias explain these find-
ings. Available evidence suggests that self-report of
receipt of preventive services appears to be a sensitive,
but not specific, measure of actual receipt of the serv-
ice.25,26 It is important to note that there does not
appear to be educational bias in reporting.27,28 Thus, it
appears unlikely that these results are primarily attrib-
utable to reporting bias.
Our data are now more than 5 years old. Consider-
able changes have occurred in managed care during
this period.29 The extent to which these findings hold
today is uncertain.
These analyses examined a limited array of health
care indicators, mostly associated with prevention.
We were not able examine educational disparities in
care for chronic conditions or health outcomes. Thus,
our findings and those from previous studies that sug-
gest HMOs might adversely affect the health status of
poorer, sicker patients are not directly comparable.11,12
Also, although we controlled for differences in the
characteristics of HMO and non-HMO members, it is
possible that unmeasured characteristics, such as atti-
tudes about health care, differed between the 2
groups.
Our analyses did not account for differences in
types of HMOs. It is possible that different types of
HMOs have differing effects on disparities. Our analy-
ses also did not account for HMO profit status. Not-

for-profit HMOs have been shown to deliver higher
quality care than investor-owned HMOs in areas
measured by Health Plan Employer Data and Informa-
tion Set (HEDIS) indicators.30 Clearly, differences
among HMOs warrant further examination, because
strengthening those kinds of HMOs that have a more
beneficial effect on disparities represents a possible
policy option for reducing disparities.
Although disparities tended to be smaller in
HMOs, in most cases these disparities were not elimi-
nated by HMO membership. Thus, there is ample
opportunity for quality improvement. HMOs, by
virtue of their population focus and reporting through
the HEDIS, are better positioned than non-HMO
plans to address disparities in care. Before they can
begin to do so directly, however, they will need to
begin collecting race, ethnicity, and education data on
their members and begin stratifying their HEDIS per-
formance measures by race-ethnicity and educational
status.31 Once determined, these disparities can be tar-
geted through quality improvement efforts using vari-
ous approaches,32 including reminder letters33,34 and
case management.35
We can only speculate about explanations for our
findings. It is possible that lower copayments improve
access to influenza vaccination within HMOs. It is
also possible that HMO physicians are targeting their
efforts toward members who have higher rates of
smoking36 and who are at higher risk because of their
lower educational status.37 Planwide interventions
undertaken by HMOs to boost use of influenza immu-
nizations, such as reminders to patients, might pro-
vide slightly greater benefit to patients who are less
aware of the potential benefits of these services. At
least among the elderly, health literacy might be even
more important than educational level in promoting
use of preventive care.38 It is possible that HMOs
more effectively promote use of these services among
this population. Alternatively, given the relatively
small observed effect sizes, it is possible that these
represent chance findings. Replication of these find-
ings using other data sets is needed. Further research
is also needed to assess the impact of improved pre-
ventive care on disparities in clinically relevant out-
comes among persons with low educational levels
enrolled in HMOs.
In summary, our results should help allay concerns
that HMOs might have an adverse impact on receipt
of preventive care by less educated persons. Instead,
the results suggest, in some instances, a modest salu-
tary effect of HMOs. Further progress in addressing
disparities in managed care will likely require perform-
ance assessment and quality improvement based on
educational attainment.31
