Context: Only limited information exists about the epi-
demiology of DSM-IV panic attacks (PAs) and panic dis-
order (PD).
Objective: To present nationally representative data
about the epidemiology of PAs and PD with or without
agoraphobia (AG) on the basis of the US National Co-
morbidity Survey Replication findings.
Design and Setting: Nationally representative face-
to-face household survey conducted using the fully struc-
tured World Health Organization Composite Interna-
tional Diagnostic Interview.
Participants: English-speaking respondents (N=9282)
18 years or older.
Main Outcome Measures: RespondentswhometDSM-
IV lifetime criteria for PAs and PD with and without AG.
Results: Lifetime prevalence estimates are 22.7% for
isolated panic without AG (PA only), 0.8% for PA with
AG without PD (PA-AG), 3.7% for PD without AG (PD
only), and 1.1% for PD with AG (PD-AG). Persistence,
lifetime number of attacks, and number of years with
attacks increase monotonically across these 4 sub-
groups. All 4 subgroups are significantly comorbid with
other lifetime DSM-IV disorders, with the highest odds
for PD-AG and the lowest for PA only. Scores on the
Panic Disorder Severity Scale are also highest for
PD-AG (86.3% moderate or severe) and lowest for PA
only (6.7% moderate or severe). Agoraphobia is associ-
ated with substantial severity, impairment, and comor-
bidity. Lifetime treatment is high (from 96.1% for
PD-AG to 61.1% for PA only), but 12-month treatment
meeting published treatment guidelines is low (from
54.9% for PD-AG to 18.2% for PA only).
Conclusion: Although the major societal burden of panic
is caused by PD and PA-AG, isolated PAs also have high
prevalence and meaningful role impairment.

EPIDEMIOLOGICAL SURVEY IN-
vestigators have helped ad-
vance understanding of
panic by studying the preva-
lence and distribution,1-3 on-
set and course,4 associations with comor-
bid disorders,5-7 and societal costs.8,9
Despite these advances, important ques-
tions remain unanswered about the epi-
demiology of panic,10 among the most im-
portant of them regarding the finding that
many people have isolated panic attacks
(PAs) that do not meet criteria for panic
disorder (PD). These people have el-
evated prevalence of other mental disor-
ders.6,11 They report greater impairment,
use of psychotropic medication, and psy-
chiatric help-seeking than people with
many Axis I disorders.8 Such findings have
led to the view that PAs are fairly nonspe-
cific risk markers for psychopathology.12
Some people with isolated PAs meet cri-
teria for agoraphobia (AG).13 It is not
known, though, whether the persistent
course and poor outcome associated with
AG among people with PD14 also apply to
PAs with AG. As a result, the boundary be-
tween PA and PD and the relative role of
AG within each are not well understood.
Investigation and comparison of these
symptom presentations in community
samplesmighthelpclarifytheseissues.The
current report presents initial data of this
sort from the recently completed US Na-
tional Comorbidity Survey Replication
(NCS-R).
METHODS

The NCS-R is a nationally representative sur-
vey of 9282 English-speaking household resi-
dents18yearsorolderinthecoterminousUnited
States. Face-to-face interviews were performed
between February 2001 and April 2003. The re-

than written to parallel the baseline NCS procedures. The hu-
man subjects committees of Harvard Medical School (Boston,
Mass) and the University of Michigan (Ann Arbor) approved the
NCS-R recruitment and consent procedures. Respondents were
interviewed in 2 parts. The part 1 interview, administered to all
respondents, included the core diagnostic assessment. The part
2 interview, administered to all part 1 respondents who met cri-
teria for any lifetime core disorder plus a probability subsample
of others (for a total of 5692 part 2 respondents), was used to as-
sess correlates and disorders of secondary interest. The part 1
sample is used here to examine prevalence and course, clinical
severity and role impairment, and most aspects of comorbidity.
The part 2 sample is used to examine comorbidity with disor-
ders of secondary interest to the survey, sociodemographic cor-
relates, and treatment. The part 1 sample was weighted to adjust
for differential probability of selection and discrepancies be-
tween the sample and the US population concerning census so-
ciodemographic and geographic variables. The part 2 sample was
weighted additionally to adjust for differential probability of se-
lection from the part 1 sample. More details on NCS-R sampling
and weights are reported elsewhere.15
PANIC AND AG
Panic and AG were assessed using the World Mental Health
Survey Initiatiave version of the World Health Organization
Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI),16 a fully
structured lay-administered diagnostic interview (available at
www.hcp.med.harvard.edu/wmhcidi). The assessment of panic
was comparable to that in previous versions of the CIDI, ex-
cept that a distinction was made between uncued PAs (de-
scribed as occurring "out of the blue" with no triggering event)
and cued PAs. A series of parallel questions was asked about
each of these 2 types of attacks. Panic disorder was defined as
the occurrence of 4 or more uncued PAs not caused by sub-
stance use or a general medical condition accompanied by
1 month or more of persistent concern about recurrence, worry
about the implications of the attacks, or significant change in
behavior because of the attacks. Agoraphobia was defined as
anxiety about 2 or more situations that had to include being in
crowds, going to public places, traveling by yourself, or traveling
away from home associated with a fear of having a PA and fear
that it might be difficult or embarrassing to escape. This fear
had to result in avoidance of the feared situations, distress when
exposed to these situations, or the necessity of a companion
during these situations. We used these classifications to de-
fine 4 subgroups for comparative analysis: PA without PD or
AG (PA only), PA with PD and AG (PA-AG), PD without AG
(PD only), and PD with AG (PD-AG). The PA-only category is
not a codable DSM-IV12 disorder; PA-AG is a subset of the
DSM-IV category AG without a history of PD, excluding respon-
dents with AG who never had a PA. This latter subgroup is not
considered in this report because we focus exclusively on people
with a history of panic.
As detailed elsewhere,17,18 blinded clinical reappraisal in-
terviews using the lifetime nonpatient version of the Struc-
tured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (SCID)19 were adminis-
tered to a probability subsample of 325 NCS-R respondents to
assess concordance with CIDI diagnoses. The CIDI-SCID con-
cordance for PD diagnosis had an area under the receiver op-
erating characteristic curve of 0.72, a moderate  value (stan-
dard error) of 0.45 (0.15), and a high odds ratio (OR) of 56.3
(95% confidence interval, 15.5-204.6). No bias was found in
the CIDI prevalence estimate compared with that in the SCID
by using a McNemar test (2
1
=0, P=.82). The CIDI-SCID con-
cordance was not assessed for PA because PA was not evalu-
ated separately in the SCID; concordance also was not as-
sessed for AG because AG occurred too infrequently in the
clinical reappraisal study for reliable analysis of concordance.
The DSM-IV requires recurrent uncued PAs, which could be in-
terpreted as 2 or more, for a PD diagnosis. However, CIDI re-
spondents who reported 2 or 3 lifetime uncued PAs generally
were found in the SCID to have had only 1 full PA with addi-
tional limited-symptom attacks. Validity of the CIDI in rela-
tion to the SCID consequently was improved when we re-
quired at least 4 lifetime uncued attacks in the CIDI. The
McNemar test result documents that the CIDI PD prevalence
estimate does not differ significantly from the SCID estimate
despite the SCID requiring only 2 attacks.
COURSE, SEVERITY,
AND IMPAIRMENT
Respondents who met DSM-IV lifetime criteria for PA were asked
to estimate the age of onset (AOO) of their first attack and AOO
of having 4 uncued attacks with a month of persistent worry.
They also were asked to estimate their age at the most recent
attack, lifetime number of uncued and cued attacks, and num-
ber of years with at least 1 attack. Clinical severity was as-
sessed only for 12-month cases by using a fully structured ver-
sion of the 7-question Panic Disorder Severity Scale (PDSS) that
was developed specifically for the NCS-R. (Question wording
is posted at www.hcp.med.harvard.edu/ncs.) The clinician-
administered version of the PDSS yields a reliable and valid as-
sessment of overall PD clinical severity.20 A separate fully struc-
tured version of the PDSS, developed independently of the
NCS-R version but with similar wording, has excellent con-
cordance with the clinician-administered version.21 Published
PDSS cut points (none, mild, moderate, or severe) were used
to define severity.
Although 2 of the 7 PDSS questions assess role impair-
ment, a more generic measure of role impairment, the Shee-
han Disability Scale (SDS),22 also was included in each section
of the CIDI. The SDS asked respondents with 12-month panic
to focus on the 1 month in the past year when their panic, their
worry about having another PA, or their restriction of activity
because of this worry interfered most with their life and activi-
ties and to rate this interference on a 0 to 10 visual analog scale
with response options of none (0), mild (1-3), moderate (4-
6), severe (7-9), or very severe (10). Interference ratings were
obtained for 4 role domains: home management, work, social
life, and personal relationships. Responses were combined by
taking the highest score across the 4 ratings and collapsing the
severe and very severe response categories.
COMORBID DSM-IV DISORDERS
The NCS-R was used to assess a number of other DSM-IV dis-
orders: other anxiety disorders (generalized anxiety disorder,
specific phobia, social phobia, posttraumatic stress disorder,
obsessive-compulsive disorder, and adult manifestations of sepa-
ration anxiety disorder), mood disorders (major depressive dis-
order, dysthymic disorder, and bipolar disorder I or II), sub-
stance use disorders (alcohol and illicit drug abuse and
dependence, in which abuse and dependence on specific illicit
drugs were combined with polysubstance abuse and depen-
dence), and impulse-control disorders (intermittent explosive
disorder and adult manifestations of 3 child-adolescent impulse-
control disorders: attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, op-
positional-defiant disorder, and conduct disorder). Organic ex-
clusion rules and diagnostic hierarchy rules were used in making
all diagnoses. As reported in more detail elsewhere,18 blinded
clinical reappraisal interviews using the nonpatient version of
the SCID19 showed generally good concordance between CIDI
and SCID diagnoses of anxiety, mood, and substance use dis-

in the range of 0.65 to 0.81,  in the range of 0.33 to 0.70, and
ORs in the range of 6.3 to 877.0. Diagnoses of impulse-control
disorders were not validated because the SCID does not assess
these disorders.
TREATMENT
Two questions about lifetime and 12-month treatment of panic
were asked at the end of the panic section. Part 2 respondents
additionally were asked more general questions about whether
they ever received treatment for any problems with your emo-
tions or nerves or your use of alcohol or drugs and, if so, about
types of professionals seen.23 Treatment was distinguished in
5 sectors: psychiatry, nonpsychiatry mental health specialty,
general medical, human services, and complementary-
alternative. Questions about treatment in the 12 months be-
fore interview asked about number and duration of visits; num-
ber and duration of psychotherapy sessions; and name, dose,
and duration of each medication used. No information was ob-
tained about the content of psychotherapy. A rough measure
of 12-month guideline-concordant treatment of panic was de-
veloped using these reports on the basis of available evidence-
based guidelines.24 Guideline-concordant treatment was de-
fined as receiving either pharmacotherapy (at least 2 months
of an appropriate medication, defined as antidepressants or anx-
iolytics,25 plus at least 4 visits to any type of medical physi-
cian) or psychotherapy (at least 8 visits with any health care
or human services professional lasting an average of at least 30
minutes). The decision to require at least 4 physician visits for
pharmacotherapy was based on the recommendation of at least
4 visits for medication evaluation, initiation, and monitoring
during the early and continuation phases of PD medication treat-
ment.24 The decision to require at least 8 psychotherapy ses-
sions was based on the fact that clinical trials demonstrating
effectiveness generally have included at least 8 psychotherapy
visits.24 Because respondents who began a course of treatment
only shortly before the interview could not fulfill the require-
ments, we counted respondents with at least 2 visits to an ap-
propriate treatment sector if they were in treatment at the time
of interview.
ANALYSIS METHODS
Cross-tabulations were used to estimate prevalence and pat-
terns of treatment. The actuarial method26 was used to esti-
mate AOO distributions. Mean comparisons were used to ex-
amine illness course and severity or impairment. Logistic
regression analysis27 was used to estimate associations with so-
ciodemographic variables and comorbid DSM-IV disorders. Be-
cause the NCS-R sample design featured weighting and clus-
tering, all analyses used the Taylor series design-based method,28
implemented in the SUDAAN software system.29 Significance
tests of sets of coefficients in the logistic regression equations
were made using Wald 2 tests based on design-corrected co-
efficient variance-covariance matrices. Statistical significance
was evaluated using 2-sided, design-based P.05-level tests.
RESULTS
PREVALENCE
Twenty-eight percent (standard error) (28.3% [1.0]) of re-
spondents met criteria for lifetime PA and 11.2% (0.5) for
12-month PA, whereas 4.7% (0.3) of respondents (roughly
one sixth of those with lifetime PA) met criteria for life-
time PD and 2.8% (0.2) for 12-month PD. Eight tenths of
1% of all respondents (roughly 3% of those with a life-
time PA) met criteria for lifetime PA-AG and 0.4% (0.1)
for 12-month PA-AG, whereas 1.1% (0.1) of respondents
(approximately one fifth of those with lifetime PD and 60%
of those with lifetime PA-AG) met criteria for lifetime
PD-AG and 0.4% (0.1) for 12-month PD-AG.
COURSE OF ILLNESS
As described, respondents with lifetime panic were
placed into 4 mutually exclusive subgroups (Figure 1):
PA only, 22.7% of the sample; PA-AG, 0.8%; PD only,
3.7%; and PD-AG, 1.1%. A small proportion of respon-
dents without PD (12.0% with PA only and 10.7% with
PA-AG) reported a sufficient number of uncued attacks
to qualify for PD (with means of 31.0 and 131.4 lifetime
uncued attacks, respectively) but failed to meet other
requirements for a PD diagnosis (Table 1). Most re-
spondents in 3 of the 4 subgroups, the exception being
PD only, reported at least 1 cued lifetime attack (from
67.9% in PD-AG to 87.6% in PA-AG). A significantly
lower 46.8% of PD-only cases reported any cued life-
time attack. Mean number of cued attacks among those
with any varies significantly across subgroups
(F3,1568
=18.2, P.001). Panic disorder is associated
with a significantly higher mean number of cued at-
tacks than PA among those without (121.8 vs 38.3,
z=6.6, P.001) and those with (134.4 vs 78.2, z=2.1,
P=.03) AG. Agoraphobia is associated with a signifi-
cantly higher mean number of cued attacks among
those with PA (78.2 vs 38.3, z=2.4, P=.02) but not
among those with PD (134.4 vs 121.8, z=0.53, P=.60).

having a cued attack, the mean number of such attacks
substantially exceeds the mean number of uncued at-
tacks in the PD-only subgroup (121.8 vs 31.3, z=7.4,
P.001) and in the PD-AG subgroup (134.4 vs 46.0,
z=4.0, P.001).
No meaningful difference exists in mean AOO of PA
among the 4 subgroups (21.5-22.7; F3,2188
=0.9, P=.44);
the entire PA AOO distribution is similar across these sub-
groups (Figure 2). Mean AOO of PD is only about 1
year later than mean AOO of PA and does not differ sig-
nificantly between the PD-only and PD-AG subgroups
(23.6 vs 22.9, F3,1568
=0.5, P=.62). Persistence (12-
month prevalence of PA among lifetime cases), how-
ever, varies substantially, from 35.7% in PA only to 62.6%
in PD-AG (2
3
=48.7, P.001). Persistence is signifi-
cantly higher in the PD than PA subgroups in the ab-
sence of AG (57.4% vs 35.7%, z=5.4, P.001) and the
presence of AG (62.6% vs 41.1%, z=3.0, P=.002) but does
not vary as a function of AG either in the 2 PA sub-
groups (41.1% vs 35.7%, z=0.9, P=.34) or in the 2 PD
subgroups (62.6% vs 57.4%, z=0.9, P=.36). Mean num-
ber of years with attacks also varies significantly across
the subgroups (F3,2188
=46.7, P.001) with the same rank
ordering as persistence.
SOCIODEMOGRAPHIC CORRELATES
We failed to find consistent variation in magnitude of sig-
nificant sociodemographic correlates of lifetime preva-
lence across the 4 subgroups, although the ORs associ-
ated with being female are noticeably higher for the PD
than the PA subgroups, whereas the ORs associated with
other employment status are noticeably higher for the AG
than non-AG subgroups (Table 2). Age of 60 years or
older (vs younger ages) and non-Hispanic blacks (vs non-
Hispanic whites) have reduced odds of panic in all 4 sub-
groups, although not all are significant. Women and pre-
viously married people have consistently elevated odds
of panic in all 4 subgroups. Respondents classified as hav-
ing other employment status, made up largely of the un-
employed and disabled, have elevated odds of all out-
comes other than PA only, whereas retired people have
elevated odds of PD-AG but not the other 3 outcomes.
None of these associations is strong in substantive terms,
though, as indicated by the Pearson contingency coeffi-
cients for the set of sociodemographic predictors all being
quite small (in the range of 0.01 to 0.02).
COMORBIDITY
Respondents in all 4 panic subgroups have significantly
increased odds of virtually all other lifetime DSM-IV dis-
orders assessed in the survey (Table 3). One or more
comorbid conditions are found in 71.9% of the PA-only

subgroup, 83.1% of the PD-only subgroup, and 100% of
the other 2 subgroups. The ORs for particular comorbid
conditions differ significantly across the 4 subgroups, with
the lowest ORs consistently in the PA-only subgroup. In
the case of comorbidity with other anxiety disorders and
major depression, AG is more important than PD, as
shown by the PA-AG ORs (4.4-24.0) consistently being
higher than the PD-only ORs (2.0-5.4) and often as high
as the PD-AG ORs (2.5-25.8). In the case of the other
mood disorders and alcohol use disorders, the PA-AG ORs
(3.2-5.1) are comparable to the PD-only ORs (3.5-5.4),
whereas the PD-AG ORs (5.6-13.6) are considerably
larger. A distinct pattern for drug use disorders for the
ORs is associated with all 3 AG or PD subgroups to be
comparable in magnitude (3.4-5.8).

spondents in the PA-AG subgroup have higher PDSS
ratings (45.3% with moderate or severe rating, and
20.2% with severe rating) than those in the PD-only
subgroup (46.1% with moderate or severe rating, and
6.0% with severe rating).
Summary SDS ratings of role impairment are similar
to PDSS ratings in being highest in the PD-AG subgroup
(95.0% with moderate or severe rating, and 84.7% with
severe rating) and lowest in the PA-only subgroup (21.3%
with moderate or severe rating, and 11.1% with severe
rating). Unlike PDSS ratings, however, the PA-AG sub-
group has lower SDS ratings (58.8% with moderate or
severe rating, and 39.0% with severe rating) than the PD-
only subgroup (76.8% with moderate or severe rating,
and 56.2% with severe rating), although the modal
rating is severe in all 3 subgroups other than in the
PA-only subgroup. In the latter, the modal rating is no
disability (70.6%).
TREATMENT
Most patients with PD obtained lifetime treatment for psy-
chiatric problems, although somewhat more so among
those with AG (96.1%) than without (84.8%) (Table 5).
Lifetime treatment proportions are lower in the PA-AG
(74.7%) and PA-only (61.1%) subgroups. The propor-
tions that obtained panic-specific treatment are only
slightly lower than overall treatment in the PD-only
(70.3% vs 84.8%) and PD-AG (85.0% vs 96.1%) sub-
groups, but substantially lower in the PA-only (16.2%
vs 61.1%) and PA-AG (37.6% vs 74.7%) subgroups. The
most common site of treatment was the general medical
sector in 3 of the 4 subgroups (32.3%-70.4%). The ex-
ception is PA-AG, in which nonmedical mental health
treatment (46.1%) is slightly more common than gen-
eral medical treatment (42.7%).
As with lifetime treatment, the proportion of 12-
month cases that received treatment in the year before
interview is highest in the PD-AG subgroup (72.6%), low-
est in the PA-only subgroup (45.7%), and intermediate
in the PA-AG (60.8%) and PD-only (66.9%) subgroups.
Also similar to the lifetime treatment data, 12-month
panic-specific treatment made up a higher proportion of
all treatment in the PD-only (43.9% vs 66.9%) and PD-AG
(52.7% vs 72.6%) subgroups than in the PA-only (14.7%
vs 45.7%) and PA-AG (29.7% vs 60.8%) subgroups.
Twelve-month treatment was obtained in the general
medical sector more often than in any other sector in each

of the 4 subgroups (25.5%-46.0%). The proportions that
obtained treatment consistent with basic treatment guide-
lines did not differ markedly across the 3 subgroups with
PD or AG (40.6%-54.9%). Although treatment meeting
basic guidelines was received by a substantially lower pro-
portion of patients in the PA-only subgroup (18.2%), pub-
lished treatment guidelines apply to PD and AG, not to
isolated PAs.
COMMENT
These results should be interpreted in light of several limi-
tations. First, the response rate was only 70%. As de-
scribed in more detail elsewhere,15 we assessed this prob-
lem in a nonrespondent survey in which a subsample of
initial nonrespondents was offered a large financial in-
centive ($100) to complete a short (15-minute) tele-
phone interview that included CIDI diagnostic stem ques-
tions. No significant difference was found in panic stem
question endorsement compared with responses in the
main survey sample, indirectly arguing against large non-
response bias on the basis of panic. Second, although good
concordance with SCID PD diagnoses was found, no va-
lidity data were obtained for PA or AG. Third, possibly
biased information about AOO, persistence, and other
important course and treatment variables were ob-
tained retrospectively. As described in more detail else-
where,16 a number of strategies were used in the NCS-R
to reduce recall bias. Evidence exists that these strate-
gies improved the accuracy of retrospective AOO re-
ports,30 but we have no data about effects on other as-
pects of recall.
With these limitations as a backdrop, the NCS-R life-
time prevalence estimates of DSM-IV PD and PD-AG (4.7%
and 1.1%, respectively) are similar to the DSM-III-R1 es-
timates in the baseline NCS (3.5% and 1.5%, respec-
tively). The NCS-R estimate of PD-only prevalence (3.7%)
is substantially higher than in the NCS (2.0%).2 Al-
though higher than in earlier epidemiological surveys,31
the concordance of the NCS-R PD prevalence estimate
with an independent SCID estimate argues against up-
ward bias. In the case of AG, the concern is more with
downward than upward bias because the CIDI require-
ment of anxiety about multiple situations is stricter than
the DSM-IV requirement.
Estimates of persistence, sociodemographic corre-
lates, and psychiatric comorbidity are broadly consis-
tent with the baseline NCS1,2,32 and other previous epi-
demiological surveys,14,31,33-35 although direct comparison
is not possible because previous surveys did not disag-
gregate panic into the 4 subgroups considered here. High
prevalence among women, low prevalence among the el-
derly, and strong comorbidity with other anxiety and
mood disorders are all noteworthy consistencies with pre-
vious survey findings. One notable difference is a much
higher estimated lifetime prevalence of PAs in the NCS-R
(28.3%) than in the NCS (7.3%), a discrepancy presum-
ably caused by the more detailed stem questions in the
DSM-IV version of the CIDI than in the DSM-III-R ver-
sion that suggests PAs were underestimated in the base-
line NCS.
We are aware of no previous general population re-
search in which investigators compared the prevalence
and correlates of isolated PAs vs PD with and without
AG. The most striking results of this comparison are that
isolated PAs are common and significantly comorbid with
other DSM-IV disorders. These results are consistent with
results from clinical studies.36,37 Most people with iso-
lated PAs fail to meet PD criteria because they never had
recurrent uncued attacks, although they typically had nu-
merous cued attacks. Another notable subgroup result
is that cued attacks are more common than uncued at-
tacks even among people with PD. This finding is espe-
cially striking given that probing often uncovers ini-
tially unrecognized panic cues,38,39 which means that the
NCS-R probably leads to underestimating the propor-
tion of attacks that are cued. We also found that persis-
tence and lifetime number of attacks are more strongly
related to PD than to AG; that comorbidity, especially
with other anxiety disorders, is more strongly related to
AG than to PD; and that isolated PAs are associated with
substantial role impairment when they occur in conjunc-
tion with AG.
The subgroup results suggest that AG and PD are to
some extent distinct, as about 40% of all respondents with
PA and AG never met criteria for PD. This finding is con-
sistent with family aggregation studies, which show that

risk of AG is significantly elevated among relatives of
people with PA-AG40 and relatives of people with PD-AG
compared with those with PD only.39,41 Family genetic
studies also suggest that AG and PD may have at least
some distinct pathogenic mechanisms.42,43 At the same
time, our finding of higher conditional prevalence of AG
among people with PD than PA is consistent with the
strong association between AG and PD long observed in
clinical settings.
The subgroup results document monotonic increases
from PA only to PD-AG in number of attacks, comorbid-
ity, clinical severity, role impairment, and treatment seek-
ing, with intermediate values for PA-AG and PD only. To-
gether with the finding that a high proportion of AG is
associated with PA, these results could be interpreted as
suggesting that panic exists along a continuum in which
PA and PD differ in degree rather than in kind. This in-
terpretation is consistent with prior findings that infre-
quent, spontaneous PAs are common in the general popu-
lation,41,42 that these attacks typically include fewer and
less severe symptoms than those in patients with PD,43 and
that infrequent PA aggregates with PD in families.40,44
The distinction between cued and uncued attacks might
be called into question as part of this same line of thinking
based on the view that most PAs are to some extent
cued.37,45,46 It would be premature to conclude from these
results that the boundary between PA and PD is arbitrary.
Nevertheless, given the high prevalence of PA only and the
negative outcomes associated with PA only, future re-
searchmightprofitablyattempttostudyPAonlyandevalu-
ate whether diagnostic criteria or symptom thresholds for
PD should be modified to improve differentiation be-
tween pathological and normal panic experiences.
An innovation of the NCS-R was the use of a fully struc-
tured version of the PDSS to assess clinical severity. Al-
though lower than in clinical samples, 86.3% of respon-
dents with PD-AG and 45.3% to 46.1% of those with
PA-AG and PD only were in the clinically important range
on the PDSS. A related finding is that clinical severity as-
sessed in the PDSS and role impairment assessed in the
SDS appear to be influenced nearly as much by AG
(PA-AG vs PA only) as by PD (PD only vs PA only). This
finding is consistent with prior findings that AG is asso-
ciated with panic severity, anticipatory anxiety, and cog-
nitive correlates of severity41,47-49 and our finding that AG
is more common among people with PD than PA. Also
consistent with this pattern is the higher average life-
time number of PAs among respondents with vs those
without AG in both the PA and PD samples. One pos-
sible interpretation of this pattern is that AG is a sever-
ity marker of panic, although this is at least superficially
inconsistent with the notion in previous paragraphs that
AG is distinct from PD disorder. Another possibility is
that AG has a direct effect on impairment.
The treatment results are consistent with previous
NCS-R reports that most people with PD eventually ob-
tain treatment,23 that most active cases receive treat-
ment in a given year,50 and that most current treatment
(45%-60% across the 3 PD and/or AG subgroups) fails
to meet basic treatment guidelines.50 The latter result is
all the more striking in that our definition of treatment
quality is liberal. For example, no distinction was made
among psychotherapies despite much more evidence
for the effectiveness of some types of psychotherapy
than others in treating panic,51-53 nor was a distinction
made among antidepressants or anxiolytics despite
much more evidence for the effectiveness of some than
others.54,55 In interpreting the finding that many pa-
tients fail to receive guideline-concordant treatment,
some patients were so classified because they dropped
