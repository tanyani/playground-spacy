Medicaid Cost Containment And Access To
Prescription Drugs
States' efforts to contain the rising costs of Medicaid prescription
drugs are reducing enrollees' access to needed medications.
by Peter J. Cunningham
ABSTRACT: States have been intensifying their efforts to control rising prescription drug
costs in their Medicaid programs. This study examines the effects of five Medicaid cost con-
tainment policies on enrollees' perceptions of their ability to get prescription drugs. The re-
sults show that enrollees in states that have implemented all or almost all of these five poli-
cies have greater problems getting prescription drugs than enrollees in other states
encounter. In terms of specific policies, prior authorization and mandatory generic substitu-
tions had the largest effects on access to prescription drugs.
The increase in Medicaid outpatient
prescription drug costs and use has
been one of the main contributing fac-
tors to overall increases in program costs in
recent years. Outpatient drug spending in
Medicaid rose about 18 percent annually be-
tween 1999 and 2002, compared with 10 per-
cent for all personal health care services in
Medicaid.1 As a share of total Medicaid
spending, drug spending doubled during the
1990s, from 5.6 percent of total Medicaid
spending in 1992 to almost 12 percent in 2002.
Despite these rising costs, all states have re-
tained their outpatient prescription drug ben-
efits, which is optional in Medicaid. To contain
increasing costs, almost all states have imple-
mented one or more strategies aimed at man-
aging prescription drug use or curtailing
wasteful and ineffective use. Cost sharing (that
is, copayments) is one of the oldest and most
prevalent forms of utilization management
(UM), but a variety of other methods are in-
creasingly being used. These include prior au-
thorization, preferred drug lists, dispensing
limits, mandatory use of generics, and step
therapy.2 Many states have also tried to con-
tain costs by reducing their reimbursement to
pharmacies, negotiating supplemental rebates
with manufacturers, and monitoring high-cost
users and prescribers of drugs.
As state budgets have tightened consider-
ably since 2000--attributable in part to the in-
creases in Medicaid spending as well as to
slow economic growth--efforts to contain
Medicaid drug spending have intensified. Ac-
cording to a recent survey, the percentage of
states with mandatory prescribing of generics
increased from 36 percent in 2000 to 70 per-
cent in 2003.3 The percentage of states with
dispensing limits increased from 20 percent in
2000 to 33 percent in 2003, while the use of
cost sharing increased from 66 percent of
states in 2000 to 81 percent in 2003. Moreover,
the percentage of states using three or more
cost-control strategies has increased greatly,
from about one-third of states in 2000 to

n Previous research. Despite the near-
universal implementation of one or more cost
containment policies, virtually nothing is
known about the effects of these policies on
prescription drug costs, use, and access. Most
of the prior research on this topic dates from
the 1970s and 1980s and has focused on the ef-
fects of copayments on Medicaid prescription
drug use and spending. The findings from
these studies show that even a small copay-
ment in Medicaid (for example, fifty cents per
prescription) reduces prescription drug use
and spending across a broad range of thera-
peutic categories, including those considered
to be essential medications.4
Nevertheless, inferring the effects of recent
cost containment policies on prescription
drug use and access from this previous re-
search is questionable, given the rapid increase
in the development of new medications, use,
and spending since many of these studies were
conducted. And since most states have now
implemented more than one cost containment
policy, it is increasingly difficult to attribute
effects on use and access to any specific policy.
A more recent study (by this author) found
that prescription drug access was particularly
problematic in states that had implemented
multiple cost containment policies.5
n Present study. This study, using data
from the 2000­01 and 2003 Community
Tracking Study (CTS) household surveys,
compares the extent of prescription drug ac-
cess problems for adult Medicaid enrollees
with the access problems of adults who have
other types of insurance coverage and who
have no insurance. It then examines the effects
of cost containment policies and other factors
on prescription drug access among adult
Medicaid beneficiaries and the effect of the in-
crease in states' cost containment policies on
changes in access between 2000­01 and 2003.
Study Data And Methods
n Data. The CTS household survey is de-
signed to produce representative estimates of
health insurance coverage, access to care, use
of services, and perceived quality of care for
the U.S. population and sixty randomly se-
lected communities in thirty-four states and
the District of Columbia.6 The CTS is primar-
ily a telephone survey, supplemented by in-
person interviews of households without tele-
phones, to ensure representation. Four rounds
of the survey have been conducted since 1996;
the most recent was completed in 2003. This
study includes data from the third round of the
survey (completed in 2000­01) and the fourth
round (completed in 2003).
The overall sample for the surveys includes
about 60,000 people in the 2000­01 survey and
about 46,600 people in the 2003 survey. This
study focuses on all adults (age eighteen and
older) who reported that they were enrolled in
Medicaid, which includes about 1,600 people
represented in each of the two surveys.
n Measure of drug access. Based on a
similar question asked in the National Health
Interview Survey (NHIS), sampled people in
both the 2000­01 and 2003 surveys were asked
the following question: "During the past
twelve months, was there any time you needed
prescription medicines but didn't get them be-
cause you couldn't afford it?" Although the
question refers only to medications prescribed
by a physician, the self-reported measure is
limited in that the medical necessity of the
medication could not be verified.
The strength of the measure is that it allows
for broad comparisons of drug access between
population groups. In this sense, validity is
demonstrated by the fact that it is strongly
correlated with characteristics of populations
that are expected to have the greatest prob-
lems affording prescription drugs: namely,
poor and low-income people, uninsured peo-
ple, and people in poor health and with
chronic conditions (that is, the most frequent
users).
n Measures of Medicaid cost contain-
ment policies. The CTS survey data are
linked to data from state surveys of Medicaid
prescription drug policies sponsored by the
Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation.7 The sur-
veys were conducted in 2000 and 2003 and
thus are roughly consistent with the time peri-
ods covered in the CTS household surveys. The

surveys covered a number of policies related to
utilization management and review, payment
and purchasing policies, and institutional poli-
cies. This study focuses on five commonly used
UM policies that are likely to have the most di-
rect impact on enrollees' use and access.8
These include the following: (1) Prior
authorization: Pharmacists are required to ob-
tain approval from the state (or a subcontrac-
tor) before dispensing a drug. (2) Copayments:
Beneficiaries are required to pay a nominal
copayment for each prescription (usually be-
tween fifty cents and three dollars), although
the state cannot deny a drug because of inabil-
ity to pay the copayment. (3) Dispensing lim-
its: States limit the number of prescriptions
that Medicaid will cover during a certain time
period (for example, one month). (4) Generic
drugs: State law requires generics.9 (5) Step
therapy: Physicians need to demonstrate that a
lower-cost drug is ineffective before prescrib-
ing a more costly alternative.
There is considerable variation among
states in how these individual policies work
(for example, states use different copayment
amounts, and the medications subjected to
prior authorization and generic mandates dif-
fer across states). Accounting for all of the
variation in state policies is not feasible, and it
is unlikely that the general measure of pre-
scription drug access used in this study would
be sensitive to many of these details.
n Analysis. The study first compared ac-
cess to prescription drugs for adult Medicaid
beneficiaries with that of other adults (both
insured and uninsured) in 2003, and then it ex-
amined changes in prescription drug access
between 2000­01 and 2003. Estimates of ac-
cess by insurance coverage were also com-
puted by controlling for a variety of other fac-
tors that are likely to be correlated with
access, including age, sex, race/ethnicity, fam-
ily income, family type, health status, and
chronic conditions.10
Regression analysis was used to examine
the effects of Medicaid cost containment
methods and other factors on access to pre-
scription drugs for adult Medicaid beneficia-
ries.11 As a general test of the intensity of states'
cost containment efforts, the analysis first ex-
amined the effect of multiple cost containment
policies on access.12 Observations from the
2000­01 and 2003 surveys were pooled into a
single regression to increase the statistical pre-
cision of estimates. The analysis controlled for
differences in individual characteristics and all
other state-level factors (for example, other
state policies, including state pharmacy assis-
tance programs for dual eligibles).13
A second regression analysis was per-
formed to examine the effects of each individ-
ual cost containment policy on access. This re-
gression was identical to the first in all
respects except that Medicaid cost contain-
ment policies were specified as five separate
indicators for each policy. Examining and in-
terpreting the effects of each policy is difficult
because virtually all states have implemented
more than one policy, and there is some inter-
correlation in the effects of these policies on
access.
Study Findings
n Characteristics of Medicaid en-
rollees. Compared with all U.S. adults,
Medicaid enrollees are somewhat younger,
much poorer, more likely to be members of a
racial/ethnic minority, and likely to have less
favorable health overall and a much higher
prevalence of chronic conditions (Exhibit 1).
Lower incomes and high rates of health prob-
lems are particularly high-risk factors for
problems with affording prescription drugs.
Between 2000­01 and 2003, there was an
increase in younger Medicaid enrollees (ages
18­34), those with incomes in the near-poor
range (100­200 percent of the federal poverty
level), and married couples with children; also,
there was a decrease in those with chronic
conditions. These changes may reflect the in-
crease in Medicaid enrollment during a period
of slow economic growth and rising unem-
ployment, in which younger and healthier
adults from intact families enrolled in Medic-
aid following the loss of a job or employer-
sponsored coverage.

rollees reported that in 2003 they did not get
prescription drugs because of cost (Exhibit 2).
The extent of access problems for Medicaid
enrollees was more similar to that of people
who typically have no prescription drug cov-
erage, including Medicare enrollees with no
supplemental coverage and uninsured people.
Those with private insurance, including Medi-
care enrollees with supplemental private in-
surance, have by far the lowest rate of drug
access problems.
The high level of access problems for
Medicaid enrollees is somewhat surprising,
given that all states include prescription drug
coverage in their Medicaid programs, and cost
sharing is lower than in most private insurance

plans. High levels of access problems reflect in
large part Medicaid enrollees' much lower in-
comes and higher prevalence of chronic condi-
tions, factors that are strongly related to in-
creased access problems (discussed in greater
detail in the results of the regression).
When income, health status, and other fac-
tors are controlled for (the adjusted estimates),
rates of prescription drug access problems for
Medicaid beneficiaries are much lower and
more comparable with those of people with
private insurance coverage (Exhibit 2). As one
would expect, those who lack drug coverage
entirely, including the uninsured and Medi-
care enrollees with no other coverage, have
much higher levels of prescription drug access
problems than those covered by Medicaid and
private insurance.
There was no change between 2000­01 and
2003 in drug access for Medicaid enrollees
(findings not shown). Access problems in-
creased slightly for those with employer-spon-
sored private insurance (about one percentage
point) and decreased for uninsured people
(about three percentage points).
n Changes in Medicaid cost contain-
ment policies. A large, growing percentage of
Medicaid enrollees live in states that have im-
plemented the various cost containment poli-
cies (Exhibit 3). Perhaps even more important
is the dramatic increase in the percentage of
Medicaid enrollees who live in states with four
or five cost containment policies, from about
16 percent in 2000­01 to 62 percent in 2003. By
contrast, the percentage of enrollees who live
in states with two cost containment policies
or fewer decreased from about 34 percent in
2000­01 to 7 percent in 2003.
n Effects of multiple cost containment
policies on access. Exhibit 4 shows the re-
sults of the regression analysis for the effects of
having multiple cost containment policies on
prescription drug access, adjusting for differ-
ences in enrollee and other state characteris-
tics. Column 1 shows the increased or de-
creased probability (in percentage points) of
having access problems associated with each
factor (and controlling for all other factors),
and column 2 shows the net effect on access
associated with changes in prescription drug
policies and other factors between 2000­01
and 2003. The net effects are computed by
multiplying the change in the means of each
factor between 2000­01 and 2003 with their
respective coefficients. Thus, net effects will
be small either if there was little change in the

factor during the study period or if that factor
has a small effect on prescription drug access.
When differences in the characteristics of
Medicaid enrollees and all other state factors
are controlled for, living in states with four or
more cost containment policies increases the
probability of experiencing drug access prob-
lems by almost eleven percentage points, com-
pared with living in states with three or fewer
policies. Combined with the large increase in
the percentage of Medicaid enrollees living in
states with four or five policies between 2000­
01 and 2003, the net effect of these policy
changes was to increase the proportion of en-
rollees with access problems by about five per-
centage points overall.
n Other factors affecting drug access.
It seems probable that changes in other factors
have offset the effects of increases in Medicaid
cost containment policies, since there was no
overall change in Medicaid prescription drug
access between 2000­01 and 2003. Changes in
key characteristics of Medicaid enrollees
(noted in Exhibit 1) are one possibility, since
several of these characteristics (such as age,
family income, and number of chronic condi-
tions) also have strong effects on drug access.
However, as Exhibit 4 shows, the net
changes in access associated with these indi-
vidual characteristics are negligible. For exam-
ple, having multiple chronic conditions
strongly increases the probability of having
prescription drug access problems (16.3 per-
cent). While a decrease in the percentage of
Medicaid enrollees with multiple chronic con-
ditions resulted in a net decrease in access
problems, the effect was less than 1 percent.
Other net effects of changes in individual char-
acteristics were even smaller, and some
changes (in age and income) led to a small net
increase in access problems. When summed
across all individual characteristics, there was
no net effect on access from changes in
enrollee characteristics.
On the other hand, the results show an un-
explained decrease in the probability of pre-
scription drug access problems between the
2000­01 and 2003 surveys (as indicated by the
variable for the 2003 survey). In other words,
some other factor(s) not directly accounted for
in the regression analysis worked to reduce ac-
cess problems, offsetting the effects of the in-
crease in Medicaid cost containment policies.
It is unclear what these other factors could

be, given the relatively short time period be-
tween the two surveys. One possibility is that
even as states were becoming more aggressive
in implementing cost containment policies,
both health care providers and Medicaid en-
rollees became more knowledgeable and savvy
about how these policies worked and there-
fore better able to navigate the system to get
the prescription drugs they needed. It is also
possible that states have gained greater experi-

ence in implementing policies and have refined
them somewhat to reduce the access problems
that some beneficiaries have had.
It may also not be coincidental that there
was a small decrease in prescription drug ac-
cess problems among the uninsured during the
same time period. Improvements in safety-net
capacity and coordination during this period
may have benefited both Medicaid enrollees
and uninsured people in providing greater ac-
cess to free or lower-cost prescription drugs,
as well as in providing more
assistance to Medicaid en-
rollees in navigating the in-
creasingly complicated rules
of the Medicaid pharmacy
benefit.14
n Effects of individual
cost containment policies.
A second regression analy-
sis--identical to the first in
all respects except for the
specification of Medicaid
cost containment policies--
was performed to test the ef-
fects of individual cost containment policies.
Indicators for each of the five cost contain-
ment policies (whether or not the enrollee
lives in a state with that policy) were included
in the analysis. The results show that prior au-
thorization and generic requirements had the
largest negative effects on access: Prior autho-
rization requirements increased the probabil-
ity of prescription drug access problems by
twenty percentage points; requiring the use of
generic substitutes increased the probability
by about eight percentage points (data not
shown). Copayments, dispensing limits, or
step therapy requirements had no statistically
significant affects on access.
Prior authorization. The effects (or lack
thereof) of individual policies are difficult to
interpret, since most states have implemented
more than one policy and there is some inter-
correlation between these factors and the mea-
sure of prescription drug access. Since some
form of prior authorization is used in most
states, the large effects observed for this policy
may be more indicative of the uniqueness of
the small number of states that do not have
such requirements. States without prior au-
thorization tend to have very few cost contain-
ment policies of any type, and therefore pre-
scription drug access problems would be
expected to be much lower. Nevertheless, case
studies of states' prior authorization programs
have observed that these programs can lead to
bureaucratic and communication problems
among enrollees, providers, and pharmaceuti-
cal benefit management firms under contract
to the state, which in turn can
lead to delays and other prob-
lems with prescription drug
access.15
Genericmandates. That man-
datory generic requirements
would lead to higher reports
of access problems may also
be surprising, since these do
not imply a cost to the en-
rollee. It is possible that some
physicians continue to pre-
scribe some brand-name
drugs when generics are re-
quired because they are unaware of the policy
or they believe that a brand name is more effi-
cacious than its generic substitute. Also, some
enrollees may specifically request brand-name
drugs. If such drugs are prescribed when ge-
neric substitutes are required, enrollees would
potentially have to pay the full cost of the med-
ication.
Other policies. That copayments, dispensing
limits, and step therapy did not have inde-
pendent effects on prescription drug access
may be because they are correlated with prior
authorization and mandatory generic policies
(that is, states often have both policies), or be-
cause these policies affect relatively few people
and both the sample of Medicaid enrollees and
the measure of access are too broad to observe
the effects of these policies. For example, co-
payments and dispensing limits may affect
only the very heaviest users of prescription
drugs (of which there may be too few in the
sample to affect the overall results), whereas
step therapy applies to a relatively small num-
ber of drug classes.

Discussion
From the perspective of Medicaid enrollees,
states' efforts to contain the rising costs of pre-
scription drugs are having negative effects on
their access to prescription drugs. Although it
is not possible with the general measure of ac-
cess used in this study to distinguish between
essential and nonessential medications, previ-
ous research on the effects of copayments and
prior authorization have shown negative ef-
fects on use of prescription drugs across a
wide range of therapeutic categories, includ-
ing those considered "essential."16 That these
access problems are particularly high for peo-
ple with chronic conditions--which include a
disproportionately high number of Medicaid
enrollees--also suggests that there is unmet
need for at least some essential medications.
Ongoing increases in Medicaid prescrip-
tion drug costs and strained state budgets
mean that cost containment policies will
likely continue and even increase in states that
have so far been less aggressive. Rolling back
these policies is probably unrealistic given the
magnitude of Medicaid spending on state
budgets, especially when most private insur-
ance plans are trying to contain costs through
greater enrollee cost sharing, preferred drug
lists, and incentives to use generics. Rather,
policymakers should examine whether these
cost containment policies are inadvertently re-
stricting access to needed medications
through bureaucratic obstacles or lack of
awareness among Medicaid enrollees and pro-
viders as to how to navigate the often complex
processes of obtaining approval to use certain
drugs.
For example, pharmacists are not permit-
ted by law to deny prescriptions to Medicaid
enrollees even if they cannot pay the copay-
ment, although research has shown that many
pharmacists have poor knowledge of these re-
quirements and often collect copayments
when it is inappropriate to do so (for example,
from children under age eighteen).17 Also, prior
authorization programs in particular vary con-
siderably across states, in terms of both the
number and the types of medications that are
subject to preauthorization as well as the pro-
cesses that are established for obtaining au-
thorization for a medication. Although this
study suggests that prior authorization has re-
sulted in reduced access, more intensive case
studies of state programs reveal considerable
variation in how they operate as well as the
level of difficulty enrollees and their physi-
cians have in obtaining approval.18
Identifying the exact mechanisms by which
the various cost containment policies affect
access was not possible in this analysis be-
cause of the relatively small samples, the gen-
eral measure of access, and difficulty in devel-
oping more detailed classifications of state
policies based on available data. Further evalu-
ation and monitoring of the effects of cost con-
tainment policies on access at the state level
are key to successful implementation and
streamlining of these policies.
Ensuring that cost containment policies do
not inadvertently harm access to necessary
medications is especially important given the
high need for prescription medications among
Medicaid enrollees as well as their lower abil-
ity to use their own resources to make up for
any shortfall.

8. A notable exclusion from these five policies is the
use of preferred drug lists (PDLs), which are ex-
cluded because they were ascertained in the 2003
Kaiser Family Foundation survey but not the
2000 survey, whereas the five policies included in
the analysis were ascertained in both surveys.
PDLs are in many ways a variant of prior authori-
zation (prior authorization is needed for drugs
not on the list), and therefore the exclusion is un-
likely to have any major effects on results. In fact,
separate analyses of 2003 data only (based on the
methodology described below) did not find any
independent effect of PDLs on prescription drug
access.
9. In some states, the use of generics is encouraged
(but not required) through the use of differential
copayments, differential dispensing fees, and
provider education. The measure in this study re-
flects only states that require generics as the
most restrictive form of cost containment poli-
cies.
10. Adjusted means were computed from ordinary
least squares (OLS) regression using the 2003
survey data, with access as the dependent vari-
able and insurance coverage and other individual
characteristics as independent variables.
11. Although a probit or logistic regression is nor-
mally used when the dependent variable is bi-
nary, OLS regression was used in this analysis be-
cause the coefficients reflected linear probabili-
ties and were therefore easier to interpret. Re-
sults from a logistic regression analysis produced
very similar results.
12. The analysis focused on comparing states that
have implemented four or five policies with
states that implemented three or fewer. There
were too few states that had implemented no
policies to analyze separately, and earlier versions
of the analysis show that there were no differ-
ences in access between states with two or fewer
policies and states with three policies.
13. Dual eligibles are people who are eligible for both
Medicaid and Medicare. Binary variables for each
state were included to control for all other state-
level factors that could potentially confound the
effects of cost containment policies on prescrip-
tion drug access. A similar indicator for survey
year was included to account for all other secular
changes in access not accounted for by the vari-
ables in the model.
