Estimating the Shortfall in Hours of
Help and Adverse Consequences

Objectives. Perceived unmet need for personal assistance services (PAS) in activities of daily living (ADLs) and
instrumental ADLs and its association with reduced hours of help received and with adverse consequences due to lack of
help are examined for adults aged 18 and older using data from the 1994­1997 National Health Interview Survey on
Disability.
Methods. A two-part multivariate regression model of the probability of PAS use and hours of help received was
developed to control for need level, living arrangements, and other characteristics that may differ between persons with
met and unmet needs and to determine the shortfall in hours associated with unmet need.
Results. Individuals with unmet need for personal assistance with two or more of the five basic ADLs have a shortfall
of 16.6 hours of help per week compared with those whose needs are met. The relative shortfall is twice as great for
persons who live alone as for those who live with others. People who live alone and have unmet needs fare worse than
people with unmet needs who live with others, and both groups are more likely than those whose needs are met to
experience adverse consequences, including discomfort, weight loss, dehydration, falls, burns, and dissatisfaction with the
help received.
Discussion. Overall, just 6.6% of needed hours are unmet among the 3.3 million people needing help in two or more
ADLs. We estimate the annual cost of eliminating unmet need among persons with incomes under 300% of the
Supplemental Security Income level between $1.2 and $2.7 billion for those living alone and from $2.2 to $7.1 billion for
those living with others.
COMMUNITY-RESIDING adults of all ages with needs
for personal assistance services (PAS) in daily activities
are at risk of all or some of their needs being unmet, which can
reduce their quality of life, compromise safety, and increase
risks of a number of adverse consequences (Allen & Mor,
1997; Desai, Lentzner, & Weeks, 2001; Lima & Allen, 2001).
These include injuries from falls, burns, weight loss, de-
hydration, discomfort, and other problems that can further
worsen health and disability and increase risks of institution-
alization and death. Minimizing unmet need is the primary goal
underlying long-term care policy.
PAS refers to human help provided to individuals in specific
activities that are generally obligatory for bodily maintenance
and for living in the community, comprising the activities of
daily living (ADLs; bathing, dressing, transferring from a bed
or chair, toileting, and eating) and the instrumental activities of
daily living (IADLs; such as taking medications and shopping
for groceries). PAS include all help, whether hands-on,
standby, or supervisory, whether paid or unpaid. Unmet need
occurs when assistance from others is needed but not provided
or inadequate.
There are many causes of unmet need. Over 85% of all of the
hours of assistance people receive with ADLs and IADLs are
provided by family and friends (LaPlante, Harrington, & Kang,
2002). Informal helpers, who may have to balance other
responsibilities, including work and child care, are often limited
in the amount of help they can provide. People with low
informal resources, such as those who live alone, are especially
likely to have unmet needs and depend largely on formal
assistance, if affordable and available. Public PAS remain
biased toward institutional rather than community living
(Harrington et al., 2000), and people who live in states that
do not provide enough home- and community-based services
may be at greater risk of unmet need (LeBlanc, Tonner, &
Harrington, 2000, 2001; Muramatsu & Campbell, 2002).
To address the magnitude of the problem of unmet need for
PAS, it is useful to know what the national prevalence of unmet
need is, what populations are most at risk, and how much of
their needs are lacking. Surveys of individuals are convenient
for measuring unmet need because obtaining professional judg-
ments on a large scale is prohibitively expensive (Williams,
Lyons, & Rowland, 1997). The prevalence of survey-
discovered unmet need lies between one fifth and one third of
elderly people with PAS needs (Desai et al., 2001; Kennedy,
2001; Lima & Allen, 2001; Manton, 1989; U.S. General
Accounting Office, 1988; Williams et al., 1997).
The need for PAS spans a continuum, measured often by the
number and type of ADLs a person requires human help with.
The ADLs define a hierarchy of needs (Katz & Akpom, 1976),
with dependence in eating defining the most severe need. The
IADLs define a lesser degree of need for PAS. An important
measurement issue concerns who determines need. Bradshaw
(1972) outlined several distinctions in operationally defining
need: normative need, which is assessed by experts; felt need,
the level of help the individual feels he or she needs; expressed
need, the amount of help received or demanded by the

individual; and comparative need, disparities in help received.
Conflict arises between normative and felt need, as when
a professional feels that institutional placement is warranted but
the individual may not want it or when the individual wants
help that a professional will not give. Differences are known to
exist between professional and self-assessments of need. In one
study, self-rated ADL disability was greater than that observed
by professionals (Kelly-Hayes, Jette, Wolf, D'Agostino, & Odel,
1992). Professionals assess need differently than individuals,
but neither is necessarily better than the other (Verbrugge &
Sevak, 2002).
Certainly, if need is a continuum, then unmet need is also
a continuum. Some people may lack help entirely, whereas
others may need just a little more help. A professional may
judge that a person needs a lot of help when he or she receives
only a little. Few studies exist comparing self-reports and
professional assessments of unmet need. One study suggests
that self-ratings of unmet need may be conservative compared
with professional ratings of unmet need (Morrow-Howell,
Proctor, & Rozario, 2001).
To advance the understanding of unmet need beyond mere
prevalence, it is useful to know how much help is lacking and
what the cost might be to address it. Quantifying unmet need
for PAS in terms of the shortfall in hours of help is an important
step in that direction. This analysis builds on a prior national
study estimating hours of PAS received among adults of
all ages (LaPlante et al., 2002) to examine the relationship of
hours with unmet need. We define unmet need as the gap be-
tween felt need and expressed need. We use a large nationally
representative survey to estimate the shortfall in hours asso-
ciated with unmet need by comparing the hours of help re-
ceived by people who report that their needs are met with those
whose needs are unmet, after controlling for population
differences in need levels and demographics (comparative
need). We then estimate the cost of eliminating the unmet-need
shortfall in hours and demonstrate that unmet need is associated
with a variety of adverse consequences.
METHODS
Sample
Data are from supplements to the National Health Interview
Survey (NHIS), a large nationally representative survey of
households in the United States conducted annually by the
Census Bureau for the U.S. National Center for Health
Statistics (U.S. NCHS). Respondents to the 1994 and 1995
NHIS (94% core response rate) were given a supplemental
screening questionnaire, known as Phase I of the National
Health Interview Survey on Disability (NHIS-D; U.S. NCHS,
1998a, 1998b). The 202,560 respondents of all ages (93%
Phase I response rate) were screened for disability, using an
extensive set of criteria including functional limitation, specific
disabling diagnoses, perception of disability, and use of
disability-related services. A sample of 32,788 individuals
was reinterviewed in Phase II (89% Phase II response rate), also
known as the Disability Followback Survey. Data collection
began in September 1994 and concluded in April 1997, with
reinterviews taking place between 7 and 26 months after the
Phase I interview (normally distributed about the mean of
14 months). Phase I excluded individuals in nursing homes,
prisons, and large residential facilities. About 3.1% of the
eligible adult sample died before follow-up, 3.4% refused, 3.0%
could not be located, and 1.4% were not interviewed for un-
known reasons. A small number of respondents moved into
institutions and, although interviewed, were excluded from this
analysis (n ¼ 335). The sample for this analysis is restricted to
adults with met or unmet need for help in any IADL/ADL
(n ¼ 9,646).
Measures
Data from Phase II of the NHIS-D are used to estimate met
and unmet need for assistance with ADLs/IADLs and to
estimate hours of paid and unpaid help received. Individuals
were asked if they were helped in any of 5 ADL and 10 IADL
activities, including hands-on help, supervision, or stand-by
help, and whether they needed help or more help (activities
a person does not do for reasons other than health are
excluded). Individuals who lacked help or needed more help in
one or more ADL/IADL activities are defined as having unmet
need. For each of up to four helpers, the respondent was asked
(a) how many days the helper helped during the last 2 weeks
and (b) how many hours per day the helper provided help. The
two measures were multiplied for each helper, summed over
helpers, and divided by 2, to yield the total hours received per
week.
The survey contains a number of demographic variables that
are used in this analysis. Age and living arrangement were
measured in Phase II; gender, race, and individual income were
measured in the initial interview. A measure of the presence of
cognitive symptoms (Phase I) was constructed by combining
affirmative responses on having ``a lot of trouble concentrating
long enough to complete everyday tasks,'' being ``frequently
confused, disoriented, or forgetful,'' or having ``Alzheimer's
disease or another type of senile disorder.'' A second variable
indicating cognitive impairment was whether the respondent
had a proxy interview in Phase II because of poor memory,
senility, confusion, Alzheimer disease, or other mental
condition.
Several additional questions were asked about experiencing
discomfort and other problems when individuals could not do
activities as frequently as they needed to (Phase II). Additional
questions were asked about falls, bedsores, contractures,
dissatisfaction with the person's primary helper, and problems
of being left alone. In some cases, respondents were asked if the
problem was caused by a lack of help, thus attributing causality
to unmet need. This battery yielded 53 measures that we used
for this study. We expected that people with unmet need would
be more likely to experience these problems and be more likely
to be dissatisfied.
Less than 3% of responses are missing for the ADL need for
help items and ,6% for the IADL items. Cognitive symptoms
were missing in ,1% of records. As item nonresponse is
generally low on these measures, we assume, when it occurs,
that the individual does not have the characteristic in question.
Reason for proxy interview was not ascertained for about 20%
of those with proxy interviews; in these cases, we assume that
a proxy response was needed for reasons other than cognitive
ones.
The data set includes imputation for individual income based
on a detailed hot deck imputation procedure carried out by the
UNMET NEED FOR PERSONAL ASSISTANCE SERVICES S99
University of Michigan Survey Research Center (U.S. NCHS,
1998a, 1998b). In the sample with a need for help in IADLs/
ADLs, 33.3% had some income components imputed, the most
frequent being earnings and interest income.
The hours data used for the dependent variable included data
we imputed previously for 19.5% of persons who said they
were helped in the last 2 weeks but had missing data for the
number of days or hours per day. We used multiple imputation,
an iterative approach generally considered the most appropriate
method when dependent variable data are missing (Crawford,
Tennstedt, & McKinlay, 1995; Rubin, 1987). Indeed, missing
hours were not random: Those with missing data were actually
somewhat less disabled. The imputation involved estimating
three separate regression models for hours received from paid
helpers, a primary informal helper, and secondary informal
helpers. Independent variables included demographics, living
arrangement, income, Medicare and Medicaid coverage, supply
of helpers, and IADL and ADL activities the helpers helped
with. The imputation introduces a random component to the
regression parameters, based on their estimated variances, and
the prediction is replicated 10 times to yield a distribution of
values, which were then averaged and summed over the three
models to yield imputed total hours (LaPlante et al., 2002).
The 53 adverse consequence items had low nonresponse,
generally under 8%, with the exception being three questions
regarding needing help eating (about 16%) and several satis-
faction questions (8­15%).
Analysis Methods
We employed statistical methods to estimate the shortfall in
hours associated with unmet need. The hours data are
nonnormal in two ways: There are some cases with 0 hours
and some with a high number of hours. Using multivariate
regression methods, we estimated a two-part model of PAS
utilization (Duan, Manning, Morris, & Newhouse, 1983),
which takes into account both types of skewness: The first step
predicts whether or not any hours of help are received by
weighted logistic regression, and the second step predicts the
hours of help among recipients by weighted least-squares
(WLS) regression, using survey sampling weights in both. In
the latter, we use the logarithm of hours as the dependent
variable to eliminate right skewness. Each person's level of
need is measured by 15 dummy variables for the specific
IADLs/ADLs they need help with. The log-transformed
dependent variable in the WLS regression makes the contribu-
tions of the activities multiplicative rather than additive. That is,
the logarithm of the total hours received does not equal the sum
of the logarithms of the hours received for each activity. We
include a count of multiple activities to correct for this effect, an
integer equal to the number of activities minus 2, if help is
needed in two or more activities, or 0 otherwise.
Four dummy variables measure cognitive difficulties: having
cognitive symptoms, being unable to manage money, being
unable to manage medications, and having a proxy interview
because of a cognitive condition. Living arrangements are
measured using two dummy variables: living alone and living
with a spouse, the comparison group being those who live with
others. To identify individuals with low incomes based on
Supplemental Security Income (SSI) eligibility criteria, two
additional dummy variables are included classifying personal
income at or below 100% of SSI federal benefit rate ($446 per
month in 1994 and $458 per month in l995 if living alone; $669
per month in l994 and $687 per month in l995 if living with
a spouse) and from 101% to 300% of the SSI federal benefit
rate level, the comparison group being those with incomes
.300% of the federal benefit rate. Although individuals on
Medicaid may retain $2,000 in tangible assets, the survey
questions were not detailed enough to make further distinctions
on assets. The unadjusted data suggest that unmet need has
a larger impact among people with two or more ADLs (as
discussed herein; Table 1), so we wished to test that. We further
wished to distinguish unmet-need effects by whether people
live alone or with others. Four dummy variables measure the
effects of unmet need for four population groups of interest:
people living alone or living with others and having fewer than
two or two or more ADL needs. These groups are compared
with those who have no unmet need. We developed the models
first introducing unmet need and living arrangements, then level
of need, and finally, age, race, gender, and income. We deleted
variables not significant in either model. In the WLS model, we
ascertained that the model residuals were normally distributed.
A concern may arise over a potential circularity between the
measures of unmet need and hours of help received, in that
unmet need is determined in large part by a perceived shortfall
in hours. However, the presence of unmet need (needing more
help in any one activity) does not determine the total hours of
help received. If there were circularity, hours of help and unmet
need would be correlated, but they are not (Pearson r ¼ .002,
p ¼ .79).
The predicted probability of receiving any help is calculated
using the exponentiated model parameters from the logistic
model. To retransform the predictions of the WLS regression
(predicted logarithm of hours) into a linear scale (predicted
hours), we exponentiate the model prediction and multiply by a
retransformation or ``smearing'' factor (Duan, 1983; Duan et al.,
1983), obtained by averaging the exponentiated residuals.
Heteroscedasticity across populations requires separate smear-
ing factors (Manning, 1998). We observe smaller mean squared
residuals for people living alone (versus living with others) or
having two or more ADLs (versus less than two) and calculate
separate smearing factors for the four populations thus defined.
We then multiply the predicted probabilities of use by the
predicted hours of use. Finally, we estimate the predicted hours
of PAS for those with unmet need, along with their expected
hours if their unmet need were to be eliminated, by setting the
relevant unmet need dummy variable to zero. The difference in
expected hours represents an estimate of the shortfall in hours,
the hours that would be required to fulfill the person's needs.
The weekly shortfall is multiplied by 52 weeks to obtain an
annual estimate (which is allowable because the survey is
conducted continuously). PAS costs are assumed to be $10 per
hour on average, based on average state Medicaid reimburse-
ment data for PAS collected from a survey of state officials in
l998­1999 (LeBlanc et al., 2000, 2001). Finally, we use a boot-
strap procedure (resampling with replacement) to calculate 95%
confidence intervals around the estimated cost.
We hypothesized that the percentage of people experiencing
adverse consequences would be greater on every measure for
those with unmet versus met need, which we tested using a one-
tailed t test. Because the estimates are based on a sample of the
LAPLANTE ET AL.
S100
population, they are subject to sampling error. All estimates are
calculated using sampling weights, and sampling errors have
been calculated directly using STATA survey data commands
(Stata Corp., 2003), which take into account the geographic
clustering of the sample design by Taylor series approximation.
RESULTS
About 15.1 million community-residing adults need help in
1 of the 15 IADLs and ADLs, 21.4% of whom have unmet
need (Table 1). The percentage with unmet need is lowest for
those who need help only in IADLs (18.3%) and generally
increases with higher numbers of ADLs, from 23.6% with one
ADL need to 34.6% at four ADLs, but declines to 25.9% at five
ADLs. Most people with unmet need get some help but do not
get all the help they need. We find that only 545,000 adults
of the 3.2 million with unmet need receive no help at all,
a population with a low level of disability, mostly needing help
in IADLs only, and in particular the single activity of heavy
housework (not shown). For most people with unmet need, the
issue is not whether they get help, but how much help they get.
Relationship of Unmet Need to Hours of Help
We expect that people with unmet need would have fewer
hours of help than those whose needs are met. We find only
a small difference in the mean hours of help received between
those with unmet versus met need among people who need help
with just IADLs or only one ADL (,2 hours per week) but
large and highly significant differences for those needing help
in two or more ADLs. This group amounts to 949,000 people--
almost a million--with perceived unmet need, who average
16.1 fewer hours per week than those whose needs are met (see
Table 1). Persons with unmet needs have fewer hours for each
number of ADLs above one that they need help with, and the
differences in mean hours are statistically significant for those
needing help in two, three, or five ADLs. If we combine those
with two or more ADLs, there is a large significant difference in
mean hours for those with unmet needs, but not for those with
fewer than two ADLs.
These differences in mean hours received, however, might
be due to differences between the met-need and unmet-need
populations with respect to level of need and other individual
characteristics that influence the amount of help received. We use
multivariate methods to control for such differences to estimate
the true shortfall among people with unmet need for PAS.
Estimating the Unmet-Need Shortfall in Hours
The sample means and standard deviations are shown in
Table 2 for variables tested in the regressions, contrasting those
with and without unmet need. Adults with unmet need are less
likely to get help but receive about the same average hours
when they do get help. They are more likely than those with no
unmet need to be non-White, to be female, and to live alone.
They are less likely to live with a spouse, have a greater number
of ADLs and IADLs, are more likely to have cognitive symp-
toms but less likely to have a proxy interview for cognitive or
other reasons, and are slightly more likely to have incomes
below 100% of the SSI level.
Results from the regression models are shown in Table 3.
Both models are highly significant. All the specific IADLs/
ADLs that individuals need help with are associated with

a higher likelihood of getting help, except toileting, and all are
associated with more hours of help. The count of multiple
activities and its square are significantly negative in both
models, making a negative adjustment to the chance of getting
help and hours of help the more activities a person needs help
with. Cognitive symptoms have no relation to getting help but
are associated with more hours of help received. Proxy or
assisted interviews because of cognitive impairment have
a higher likelihood of getting help and more hours of help.
Proxy interviews for reasons other than cognitive impairment
have higher hours. Independent of measured need, neither
being non-White nor being older is associated with the odds of
getting help, but both are associated with higher hours among
those who get help, as is individual income below 300% of the
SSI level. Living alone has a large negative relation with
getting help and with hours.
Now we consider the effects of unmet need, which is
measured within four groups of interest. Among people with
less than two ADLs who live with others, unmet need is
associated with lower odds of getting help but has no relation to
hours (see Table 3). Among people with less than two ADLs
who live alone, unmet need is associated with lower odds of
getting help and fewer hours of help received. Among those
with two or more ADLs who live with others, unmet need is not
related to getting help but is associated with fewer hours.
Among those who live alone and have two or more ADLs,
unmet need is associated with a lower odds of getting help and
fewer hours. The combined effect of unmet need is largest
among people who live alone.
In Table 4, the shortfall in hours estimated by the regression
models is shown for people with two or more ADLs who have
unmet need, by living arrangement and income level. As
explained in Analysis Methods, the estimated shortfall is the
model prediction of the difference between needed and received
hours. Overall, people needing help in two or more ADLs and
reporting unmet need receive 56.2 hours of help and are

estimated to need an additional 16.6 hours of help per week.
Those living alone receive 24.1 hours of help and need an
additional 18.7 hours, a relative shortfall of 43.7% of their total
needed hours. Those who live with others receive substantially
more help (66.1 hours) but need an additional 16.0 hours; their
relative shortfall is a more modest 19.5%. People with fewer
than two ADLs with unmet need are omitted owing to their
relatively small shortfall (4 hours) and lesser policy import.
Cost of Eliminating Unmet Need
We made a simple estimate of the cost of eliminating the
shortfall in hours among people with low income (below 300%
of the SSI eligibility level) who live alone and have perceived
unmet need. The calculation is based on what it would cost to
supply enough paid hours annually to eliminate the gap in
weekly hours associated with unmet need. We assumed paid
helpers would receive an hourly rate of $10. This comes to
about $1.9 billion annually for the 195,000 people with
incomes below 300% of the SSI level (see Table 4) who live
alone, and the 95% confidence interval is from $1.2 to $2.7
billion. The cost of eliminating the shortfall in hours associated
with unmet need among the half-million people with low
income who live with others comes to about $4.7 billion; the
95% confidence interval is from $2.2 to $7.1 billion.
Negative Consequences of Unmet Need
and Dissatisfaction
Even people whose needs are usually met can experience
adverse consequences owing to lack of help, if a helper is not
available at the right time and place, or if the quality of help
is inadequate. But we would generally expect people with
perceived unmet needs to have a higher frequency of adverse
experiences. For all comparisons where a significant difference
is observed, people with unmet needs have a higher rate of

adverse consequences. Of individuals who need help with two
or more ADLs, those with unmet needs have significantly
greater probability of adverse consequences than those whose
needs are met on 29 of 34 measures tested (Table 5). These
measures include discomfort, distress, mobility restriction,
doing activities oneself that the person needs help with, and
more serious concerns such as going hungry, running out of
food, getting burned, unintentional weight loss, and dehydra-
tion. Many of these measures specifically attribute lack of help
as the cause of the events, such as going hungry because no
help was available to eat.
People with unmet needs also experience a variety of
secondary conditions (Table 6) at rates significantly higher than
those whose needs are met, including falls and injuries due to
falls, bedsores, and contractures. Of those with unmet needs,
51% attributed their falls to lack of help in getting around or
inability of their helper to prevent their falling compared with
32% of those whose needs are met. People with unmet need are
much less satisfied with their primary helper's availability and
the amount of assistance they give as well as other aspects of
their helping abilities, and they are more likely to be left alone
and to lack backup helpers.
We stratified by whether individuals lived alone or with
others, and within each group, we tested for differences
between those with unmet versus met needs. Among people
living with others, we found that those with unmet needs were
significantly more likely to report problems on 44 of the 53
measures tested (see Tables 5 and 6). Among people who live
alone, those with unmet needs were significantly more likely to
have problems on 38 of the 53 measures tested. Many of these
differences are alarmingly large. In particular, people who live
alone and have unmet need are 10 times as likely to go hungry
because no one is available to help them eat as those whose
needs are met (24.5% versus 2.1%), 20 times more likely to
miss a meal because of lack of help with shopping (15.3%
versus 0.7%), and 5 times as likely to lose weight un-
intentionally (52.2% versus 10.0%). On 24 measures, people
who live alone and have unmet needs are significantly more
likely to have problems than those who live with others and
have unmet needs (opposite of expected, having a weak helper
was significantly lower). Finally, of those whose needs are met,
those who live alone have similar rates of adverse consequences
to those who live with others: Only 8 measures were
significantly different. Thus, people who live alone and have
unmet needs fare worse than people with unmet needs who live
with others, but both have higher risk of adverse consequences
than those whose needs are met. If needs are met, rates of
adverse consequences and dissatisfaction are comparable
between those living alone or with others.
DISCUSSION
Unmet need is prevalent among adults of all ages who have
substantial needs for PAS. About 29% of adults needing help in
two or more of the five basic ADLs need more help than they
receive. In a society where 85% of hours of help come from
family and friends (LaPlante et al., 2002), the problem of unmet
need for PAS is magnified among people who live alone, 45%
of whom have unmet need, compared with 26% of those who
live with others. This study demonstrates that an association
exists between perceived unmet need and reduced hours of
help, independent of level of disability, race, age, and income
level. People who live alone and have unmet need (almost
a quarter-million people) are estimated to lack 18.7 hours of
help per week (95% confidence interval = 12.3­25.1) or 44% of
the hours they need. Those with unmet needs who live with

7.7­24.4) or 20% of the hours they need.
Unmet need is not a measure of individuals' insatiable
demands for more help. The data confirm that unmet need is
associated with higher rates of adverse consequences on 48 of
53 measures tested, including discomfort, going hungry, losing
weight, dehydration, falls, injuries due to falls, burns, and dis-
satisfaction, at much higher rates than those whose needs are
met, particularly for people who live alone. These are serious
problems that compromise the safety, comfort, and hygiene of
individuals with unmet needs, reducing their ability to live
independently and increasing their risk of institutionalization

and possibly death. Many of these events are specifically
attributed by the respondent as resulting from lack of help.
Inferring causality on other measures lacking such attributions,
like contractures and bedsores occurring in the last 3 months, is
hazardous because of the cross-sectional design of the survey.
The occurrence of such events may have precipitated a need for
more than the available level of help. Nevertheless, the weight
of the evidence clearly suggests that unmet need is associated
with and attributed to much greater adversity.
Limitations to these findings include the fact that need and
unmet need are self-reported or proxy reported, whereas pro-
fessional assessment could yield different results. Hours for
those whose needs are met are the standard against which the
unmet-need shortfall is defined, and those hours are likely to be
influenced by whether they are self-reported, proxy reported, or
assessed by a professional. Item nonresponse necessitated
imputation and proxy reporting raised questions of potential
bias in reporting levels of need, unmet need, and hours.
However, we determined that results were robust even when
imputed hours and proxy reports were separately excluded in
the analysis (results not shown). Nevertheless, professional
assessment could yield a different estimate of the shortfall.
Working-age adults account for half the prevalence of met
and unmet need among those needing help in two or more
ADLs. We analyzed the working-age population separately and
found the results robust, although the relative shortfall in
needed hours is somewhat smaller than for all ages combined
(18% versus 23%, results not shown). However, unmet need
among people living alone is more an issue for the elderly,
because two thirds of those living alone and needing more help
are age 65 or older. It is notable that both age and being non-
White have positive relationships to hours received after
controlling for level of need, which may represent sociocultural
differences in informal helping.
Access to paid help is critical for people who live alone
because they are much more likely to receive paid help than are
people who live with others (62% versus 24%; p , .001, not
shown). Of people who live alone, those whose needs are met
are more likely than those whose needs are unmet to get paid
help (70.2% versus 50.3%; p , .001, not shown). More than
half of that paid help is reported to be paid by Medicare or
Medicaid. Among people living with others, the difference in
getting paid help by unmet need is much smaller (25.7% versus
19.4%; p , .001, not shown). Thus, expanding access to paid
PAS appears crucial in reducing unmet need among those who
live alone. A limitation of the data is that family helpers were
not asked if they were paid, which may accentuate differences
between paid and unpaid help by living arrangement.
If the estimated shortfall in hours were to be provided
through public funds, the cost of eliminating unmet need
among people who live alone with low incomes ranges from
$1.2 to $2.7 billion, a relatively small amount. However, the
cost for people who live with others is more than twice as large,
from $2.2 to $7.1 billion.
People who live with others get twice as many hours of help
per person, independent of need and unmet need. Is the lower
level of help provided to people who live alone a problem?
Actually, people who live alone and whose needs are met are

no more likely to experience adverse consequences than people
who live with others and have their needs met, which suggests
that the difference in hours is not a problem. It seems more
likely that the difference in hours represents a different
accounting of help received. After all, among people who live
alone, helpers come in to the home usually with a set of goals to
be achieved in a limited time. It is a different case when the
person lives with someone who provides help continuously
throughout the day. A different accounting does not imply that
the unmet-need shortfall in hours for people who live with
others is not real. They do have higher risk of adverse
consequences when their needs are unmet, although not as
extreme as for those who live alone.
There are some problems to be dealt with in reducing unmet
need for PAS. The potential for greater publicly financed help
to displace unpaid help has been acknowledged (Kemper, 1992;
Moscovice, Davidson, & McCaffrey, 1988). Some research
suggests that paid services complement, rather than substitute
for, unpaid care (Liu, Manton, & Aragon, 2000). The potential
substitution effect is much less an issue for people who live
alone, only one third of whom are helped by children or
relatives, than it is among people who live with others and have
unmet needs, of whom about 90% are helped by relatives,
usually a spouse.
Greater public provision of help to low-income individuals is
required to reduce unmet need among those who live alone, but
it is not the only remedy for those who live with others. Other
strategies may be considered to increase informal hours for
those living with others by defraying the personal costs that
helpers and their families incur, such as providing tax credits
for helpers, and by other financial incentives to foster more
informal help. However, these strategies do not focus on unmet
need and would provide resources to those whose needs are
already being met (or their caregivers) and who have lower risk
of adverse consequences than those with unmet need.
Finally, human help is not always the best solution even for
those who feel they need it. Trying to eliminate unmet need
only by fulfilling people's wishes for more human help, without
considering alternative ways to accomplish activities through
use of assistive technology (Verbrugge & Sevak, 2002) and
environmental modification (Lawton, 1982), could result in less
empowerment, greater learned dependency, and greater societal
expense.
Legal precedents such as the Supreme Court's Olmstead
decision (U.S. Government Accounting Office, 2001) and leg-
islative initiatives such as the Medicaid Community Attendant
Services and Supports Act (MiCASSA; Harkin & Spector,
2001) would enable individuals to live in the least restrictive
setting they desire. However, such efforts to reduce society's
reliance on institutions cannot work if individuals' needs are
not well met in the community.
Previous research, by looking only at the prevalence of
unmet need for PAS, creates a false impression that unmet need
is a large and costly problem to resolve. In fact, only 6.6% of all
needed hours of help are unmet among adults needing help in
two or more ADLs. The reduction, if not the elimination, of
unmet need for PAS is a financially achievable goal for the
nation and one that long-term care policy should focus on.
