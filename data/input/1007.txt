Context: Little is known about lifetime prevalence or
age of onset of DSM-IV disorders.
Objective: To estimate lifetime prevalence and age-of-
onset distributions of DSM-IV disorders in the recently
completed National Comorbidity Survey Replication.
Design and Setting: Nationally representative face-to-
face household survey conducted between February 2001
and April 2003 using the fully structured World Health
Organization World Mental Health Survey version of the
Composite International Diagnostic Interview.
Participants: Nine thousand two hundred eighty-two
English-speaking respondents aged 18 years and older.
Main Outcome Measures: Lifetime DSM-IV anxiety,
mood, impulse-control, and substance use disorders.
Results: Lifetimeprevalenceestimatesareasfollows:anxi-
ety disorders, 28.8%; mood disorders, 20.8%; impulse-
control disorders, 24.8%; substance use disorders, 14.6%;
any disorder, 46.4%. Median age of onset is much earlier
for anxiety (11 years) and impulse-control (11 years) dis-
orders than for substance use (20 years) and mood (30
years) disorders. Half of all lifetime cases start by age 14
years and three fourths by age 24 years. Later onsets are

of any disorder at age 75 years (50.8%) only slightly higher
than observed lifetime prevalence (46.4%). Lifetime preva-
lence estimates are higher in recent cohorts than in earlier
cohorts and have fairly stable intercohort differences across
the life course that vary in substantively plausible ways
among sociodemographic subgroups.

THEPURPOSEOFTHECURRENT

the DSM-IV disorders assessed in the re-
cently completed National Comorbidity
SurveyReplication(NCS-R).1 WhiletheEpi-

thebaselineNationalComorbiditySurvey
(NCS)3 both reported high lifetime preva-
lence and generally early age-of-onset dis-
tributionsofmostDSM-III(NCS)andDSM-
III-R (NCS-R) disorders, it is not clear
whether similar results will hold for DSM-
IVdisordersbecauseofthegreaterempha-
sisonclinicallysignificantdistressandim-
pairmentinDSM-IVthaninearliereditions.
Inadditiontoexaminingprevalenceand
age-of-onset distributions, we distinguish
between lifetime prevalence, the propor-
tion of those in the population who had a
disorderatsometimeintheirlifeuptotheir
age at interview, and projected lifetime risk,
the estimated proportion of those in the
population who will have the disorder by
the end of their life. Lifetime risk cannot be
estimated directly from community sur-
veys because respondents in such surveys
differ in age and, therefore, in number of
years of expected future risk. Projections
of estimated future risk can be made from
surveydata,though,usingeithertheKaplan-
Meier method4 or the slightly more precise
actuarial method5 to estimate survival dis-
tributions. Although lifetime risk esti-
mates are useful in assessing societal bur-
den, we are aware of no previous published
report that has presented such estimates for
a wide range of mental disorders.

nous United States. Face-to-face interviews were carried out by
professional interviewers from the Institute for Social Research
attheUniversityofMichigan,AnnArbor,betweenFebruary2001
and April 2003. The response rate was 70.9%. The survey was
administered in two parts. Part I included a core diagnostic as-
sessment of all respondents (n=9282) that took an average of
about 1 hour to administer. Part II included questions about risk
factors, consequences, other correlates, and additional disor-
ders. In an effort to reduce respondent burden and control study
costs, part II was administered only to 5692 of the 9282 part I
respondents, including all part I respondents with a lifetime dis-
order plus a probability subsample of other respondents. Inter-
viewers explained the study and obtained verbal informed con-
sent prior to beginning each interview. Recruitment and consent
were approved by the Human Subjects Committees of Harvard
Medical School, Boston, Mass, and the University of Michigan.
MEASURES
Diagnostic Assessment
The NCS-R diagnoses are based on the World Mental Health
Survey Initiative Version of the World Health Organization Com-
posite International Diagnostic Interview (WMH-CIDI),6 a fully
structured lay-administered diagnostic interview that gener-
ates both International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revi-
sion,7 and DSM-IV8 diagnoses. The DSM-IV criteria are used here.
Diagnoses include anxiety disorders (panic disorder, agora-
phobia without panic disorder, specific phobia, social phobia,
generalized anxiety disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder, ob-
sessive-compulsive disorder, separation anxiety disorder), mood
disorders (major depressive disorder, dysthymia, bipolar I and
II disorders), a series of four disorders that share a common
feature of difficulty with impulse control (intermittent explo-
sive disorder, oppositional-defiant disorder, conduct disor-
der, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder), and four sub-
stance use disorders (alcohol abuse, drug abuse, alcohol
dependence, drug dependence). Posttraumatic stress disor-
der, obsessive-compulsive disorder, drug abuse, and drug de-
pendence were included in part II because they all required ex-
tensive introductory questions that precluded the quick skipout
of noncases that we wanted in part I. The four disorders that
require onset of symptoms in childhood (separation anxiety dis-
order, oppositional-defiant disorder, conduct disorder, and at-
tention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder) were also included in part
II and limited to respondents in the age range of 18 to 44 years
because of concerns about recall bias among older respon-
dents. All other disorders were included in part I. Organic ex-
clusion rules and hierarchy rules were used to make all diag-
noses other than the diagnoses of substance use disorders.
Substance use disorders were diagnosed without hierarchy in
the recognition that abuse often is a stage in the progression to
dependence.BlindclinicalreinterviewswiththeStructuredClini-
cal Interview for DSM-IV (SCID)9 (Table 1) generally were
in good concordance with WMH-CIDI diagnoses for anxiety,
mood, and substance use disorders. Impulse-control diag-
noses were not validated.
Retrospective age-of-onset reports were obtained in the
WMH-CIDI using a series of questions designed to avoid the
implausible response patterns obtained when using the stan-
dard CIDI age-of-onset question.10 The sequence began with a
question designed to emphasize the importance of accurate re-
sponses: "Can you remember your exact age the very first time
you (HAD THE SYNDROME)?" Respondents who answered
"no" were probed for a bound of uncertainty by moving up the
age range incrementally (eg, "Was it before you first started
school?" "Was it before you became a teenager?"). Age of on-
set was set at the upper end of the bound (eg, age 12 years for
respondents who reported that onset was before they became

a teenager). Experimental research has shown that this se-
quence of questions yields responses with a much more plau-
sible age-of-onset distribution than the standard CIDI age-of-
onset question.11 Although age-of-onset questions were asked
about both important symptoms (eg, first panic attack) and full
syndromes, the ages used herein are for syndromes.
Predictor Variables
Predictor variables included cohort (defined by age at inter-
view 18-29, 30-44, 45-59, or 60 years), sex, race/ethnicity
(non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, Hispanic, or other),
education (students vs nonstudents with 0-11, 12, 13-15, or
16 years of education), and marital status (married/
cohabitating, previously married, never married). Marital sta-
tus was coded for each year of each respondent's life. Educa-
tion was also coded as a time-varying predictor by assuming
an orderly educational history, with 8 years of education cor-
responding to being a student up to age 14 years, and with other
durations based on this benchmark.
ANALYSIS METHODS
The data were weighted to adjust for differential probabilities
of selection, differential nonresponse, and residual differences
in sociodemographic variables between the sample and tract-
level 2000 US Census population. An additional part II weight
adjusted for oversampling of part I cases. Weighting is de-
scribed in more detail elsewhere.1
Lifetime prevalence was estimated as the proportion of re-
spondents who had ever had a given disorder up to their age at
interview. Age of onset and projected lifetime risk as of age 75
years were estimated using the two-part actuarial method imple-
mented in SAS version 8.2.12 The actuarial method differs from
the more familiar Kaplan-Meier4 method in using a more ac-
curate way of estimating onset within a given year.5 This method
assumes constant conditional risk of onset during a given year
of life across cohorts.
Sociodemographic predictors were examined using dis-
crete-time survival analysis with person-years as the unit of
analysis.13 Sociodemographic variables that change over time
(educational attainment, marital status) were treated as time-
varying predictors. Changes in the effects of predictors across
cohort were evaluated by including interactions between pre-
dictors and cohort.
Standard errors of prevalence estimates and survival coef-
ficients were estimated using the Taylor series linearization
method14 implemented in the SUDAAN software system.15 Mul-
tivariate significance tests were made with Wald 2 tests using
Taylor series design-based coefficient variance-covariance ma-
trices. Standard errors of lifetime risk estimates were esti-
mated using the jackknife repeated replication method16 imple-
mented in a SAS macro.12 All significance tests were evaluated
at .05 with two-sided tests.
RESULTS
LIFETIME PREVALENCE
The most prevalent lifetime disorders (Table 2) were
major depressive disorder (16.6%), alcohol abuse (13.2%),
specific phobia (12.5%), and social phobia (12.1%). Anxi-
ety disorders were the most prevalent class of disorders
(28.8%), followed by impulse-control disorders (24.8%),
mood disorders (20.8%), and substance use disorders
(14.6%). The lifetime prevalence of any disorder was
46.4%, while 27.7% of respondents had two or more life-
time disorders and 17.3% had three or more.
Prevalence estimates varied significantly with age for
all but a handful of disorders. A monotonic increase in
prevalence was generally found from the youngest (18-29
years) to a higher (for the most part, 30-44 years) age
group and then a decline in the older age group(s). Preva-
lence was always lowest, sometimes substantially so, in
the oldest age group (60 years). The most dramatic dif-
ferences of this sort were for drug abuse and drug de-
pendence, posttraumatic stress disorder, and bipolar I and
IIdisorders.Prevalencedifferencesweremuchlessmarked
among the other three age groups.
AGE OF ONSET DISTRIBUTIONS
The distributions of cumulative lifetime risk estimates
were standardized and examined for fixed percentiles
(Table 3). Two patterns emerged. First, the median age
of onset (ie, 50th percentile on the age-of-onset distri-
bution) was much earlier for anxiety disorders (age 11
years) and impulse-control disorders (age 11 years) than
for substance use disorders (age 20 years) and mood dis-
orders (age 30 years). Second, age of onset was concen-
trated in a very narrow age range for most disorders, with
interquartile ranges (IQRs) (ie, the number of years be-
tween the 25th and 75th percentiles of the age-of-onset
distributions) of only 8 years (age 7-15 years) for impulse-
control disorders, 9 years (age 18-27 years) for sub-
stance use disorders, and 15 years (age 6-2 years) for anxi-
ety disorders compared with 25 years (age 18-43 years)
for mood disorders.
Mostdisorder-specificage-of-onsetdistributionsshared
important features with other disorders in their class. In
particular, the median age of onset was earlier for each
impulse-control disorder (age 7-15 years) than for any
substance (age 19-23 years) or mood (age 25-32 years)
disorder, while the IQR was consistently narrower for each
of the impulse-control (1-6 years) and substance use (6-12
years) disorders than for any mood disorder (25-26 years).
The age-of-onset distributions of anxiety disorders were
more diverse, with specific phobia and separation anxi-
ety disorder having very early median ages of onset (age
7 years) and very narrow IQRs (4-7 years), social pho-
bia having a later median age of onset (age 13 years) and
a narrow IQR range (7 years), and other anxiety disor-
ders having much later median ages of onset (age 19-31
years) and much wider IQRs (16-27 years).
PROJECTED LIFETIME RISK
Projected lifetime risk as of age 75 years based on the age-
of-onset distributions (Table 3) was 9% higher than life-
time prevalence estimates reported in Table 2 for anxiety
disorders, 34% higher for mood disorders, 2% higher for
impulse-control disorders, 12% higher for substance use
disorders, and 9% higher for any disorder. Predictably, dis-
orders with the largest increases between prevalence and
projected risk were those with late age-of-onset distribu-
tions: major depressive disorder, generalized anxiety dis-
order, and posttraumatic stress disorder. Consistent with
the prevalence data, projected risk was highest for anxi-

ety disorders (31.5%), but the order was reversed for im-
pulse-control and mood disorders--the former having
higher prevalence (24.8% vs 20.8%) and the latter higher
projected risk (28.0% vs 25.4%). Substance use disorders
had the lowest projected risk (16.3%). The individual dis-
orderswiththehighestprojectedriskwereidenticaltothose
with the highest prevalence. Over 80% of projected new
onsets were estimated occur to people who had already
had disorders. This can be seen by noting that the overall
projected lifetime risk in the total sample was only 4.4%
higher than the lifetime prevalence reported in Table 2
(50.8% vs 46.4%), while disorder-specific risk-vs-
prevalence differences added to 20.4%.

1940) were used to predict lifetime disorders using dis-
crete-time survival analysis. The odds ratios (ORs) were
statistically significant in the vast majority of compari-
sons, with a consistent positive association between re-
cency of cohort and OR of onset (Table 4). The largest
cohort effects were associated with drug use disorders
and the smallest with phobias and childhood-onset im-
pulse-control disorders.
The cohort model was elaborated to evaluate whether
intercohort differences decreased significantly with in-
creasing age, a pattern that might be expected either if
lifetime risk was actually constant across cohorts but ap-
peared to vary with cohort because onsets occurred ear-
lier in more recent cohorts than in earlier cohorts (due
to either secular changes in environmental triggers or age-
related differences in age-of-onset recall accuracy) or if
differential mortality had an increasingly severe effect on
sample selection bias with increasing age. Differences were
examined separately for first onsets in the age ranges 1
through 12, 13 through 19, 20 through 29, 30 through
39, 40 through 49, and 50 through 59 years, the last of
these age intervals being the upper end of the age distri-
bution of the second-oldest cohort quartile, making it im-
possible to study intercohort differences beyond this age.
No evidence of decreasing cohort effects with increas-
ing age was found for anxiety or mood disorders
(Table 5). In contrast, dramatic differences emerged for
substance use disorders, with much higher cohort ef-
fects in the teens and 20s than in either childhood or the
30s through 50s.
SOCIODEMOGRAPHIC PREDICTORS
A number of sociodemographic variables were signifi-
cantly related to lifetime risk of NCS-R disorders in sur-
vival analyses that controlled for cohort (Table 6).
Women had a significantly higher risk than men of
anxiety and mood disorders. Men had a significantly
higher risk than women of impulse-control and sub-
stance use disorders. Non-Hispanic blacks and Hispan-
ics had a significantly lower risk than non-Hispanic
whites of anxiety, mood, and substance use disorders

(the latter only among non-Hispanic blacks). Low edu-
cation was associated with a high risk of substance use
disorders. Marital disruption was associated with 3 of
the 4 classes of disorder, the exception being impulse-
control disorder.
To determine whether increasing prevalence in more
recent cohorts was concentrated in certain population
segments, we also examined whether sociodemo-
graphic correlates varied by cohort. Although at least
one significant interaction was found for each sociode-
mographic predictor, the pattern was not consistent
(results available on request from the authors). The
most notable results were as follows: Sex differences in
anxiety, mood, and impulse-control disorders did not
differ across cohorts, but women were more similar to
men in substance use disorders in recent cohorts. The
significant inverse associations with substance use dis-
orders of education and being married existed only in
recent cohorts.
COMMENT
The results reported herein are limited by four possible
biases, all of which make the prevalence and risk esti-
mates conservative. First, people with a history of men-
tal illness might have been less likely than others to par-
ticipate in the survey either because of sample frame
exclusions (eg, excluding homeless people from the sam-
pling frame), differential mortality, or greater reluc-
tance to participate. There is evidence that bias of the lat-
ter sort (reluctance to participate) exists in psychiatric
epidemiological surveys,17 although no evidence of such

bias was found in a nonrespondent survey carried out in
conjunction with the NCS-R.18
Second, lifetime prevalence was likely to be underre-
ported in the sample because of the well-known bias
against reporting embarrassing behaviors.19 This type of
bias is not ruled out by the concordance found between
diagnoses based on the WMH-CIDI and independent clini-
cal reinterviews, as similar bias can occur in clinical in-
terviews. Experimental studies to evaluate the effects of
strategies designed to decrease embarrassment and to in-
crease accurate reporting have consistently shown sig-
nificant increases in reports of mental illness.20,21 As dis-
cussed in more detail elsewhere,6 a number of these
strategies were used in the NCS-R, but it is unlikely that
they were completely successful.
Third, the method used to estimate lifetime risk was
based on the assumption of constant conditional risk of
first onset in a given year of life among people who dif-
fer in age at interview. This assumption is almost cer-
tainly incorrect in light of evidence for significant inter-
cohort differences in lifetime prevalence. Because the
estimated prevalence was higher in more recent co-
horts, lifetime risk in younger cohorts will be underes-
timated in models based on the assumption of constant
intercohort conditional risk.
Fourth, age at onset can be recalled incorrectly, pos-
sibly as a function of age at interview and in conjunc-
tion with age-related failure to recall lifetime disorders.
Simon and Von Korff10 reported evidence of this prob-
lem in the Epidemiologic Catchment Area study, in which
age-at-onset reports were a mean of approximately 10
years before the interview regardless of the respondent's
age. This kind of age-related age-at-onset telescoping in
conjunction with age-related failure to report past dis-
orders can create the false appearance of a cohort effect.22
Although the NCS-R used a novel probing strategy to as-
sess age at onset that was shown experimentally to cor-
rect the biased data pattern found by Simon and Von
Korff,11 it is unlikely that this strategy corrected com-
pletely for age-related recall bias.
Based on these considerations of possible bias, the
NCS-R estimates of lifetime prevalence and projected risk
are likely to be conservative. The estimates of anxiety,
mood, and substance use disorders are broadly consis-
tent with those found in previous community surveys in
the United States3,23 and elsewhere in the world24,25:
(1) A high proportion of the population met the criteria
for one or more of these disorders at some time in their
life. (2) Major depressive disorder, specific phobia, so-
cial phobia, and alcohol abuse were the most common
individual disorders. (3) Anxiety disorders were the most
common class of disorders. The main inconsistency with
previous results is that the estimated prevalence of sub-
stance use disorders was considerably lower in the NCS-R

cohort and person-years in the lives of respondents. This was not done for impulse-control disorders because the vast majority of such disorders have onsets in a
very narrow time window. Cohort  person-year interactions had significant predictive value for each of the 3 disorder groups. Based on these results, subsample

than in the NCS. This is presumably because the DSM-IV
criteria are stricter than the DSM-III-R criteria (espe-
cially in requiring criterion A symptoms to cluster in a
single year of life).
Although we know of no previous attempt to esti-
mate the lifetime prevalence of DSM-IV oppositional-
defiant disorder, conduct disorder, or attention-deficit/
hyperactivitydisorderinanationallyrepresentativesample
of adults, the NCS-R estimates are in the range reported
in epidemiological surveys of adolescents.26,27 The NCS-R
prevalence estimate for intermittent explosive disorder
is also consistent with the scant data on the prevalence
of that disorder.28 Given that previous epidemiological
surveys excluded these impulse-control disorders, it is
striking that their combined lifetime prevalence is higher
than that for either mood disorders or substance use dis-
orders.
High prevalence estimates in previous psychiatric epi-
demiological surveys have been a source of two con-
cerns to mental health policy analysts. The first is that
the estimates are so high as to be scientifically implau-
sible.29 We addressed this issue earlier when we noted
that concordance is generally good between WMH-
CIDI and SCID diagnoses and that the WMH-CIDI is con-
servative relative to the SCID. A critic might conclude
that the DSM-IV system itself is overly inclusive. How-
ever, it is noteworthy that preliminary analyses of the 12-
month NCS-R data show that even those 12-month WMH-
CIDI disorders that were classified as mild were associated
with levels of impairment equivalent to those caused by
clinically significant chronic physical disorders. Based on
this evidence, it would be difficult to make a principled
argument for narrowing the diagnostic criteria in future
editions of the DSM to raise the threshold for clinical sig-
nificance.
The second concern about high prevalence estimates
is that, even if accurate, they correspond to many more
people than can be helped by currently available treat-
ment resources30 and consequently have no practical short-
term implications other than perhaps reducing support for
parity of treatment with physical disorders.31 In consid-
ering these issues it is important to note that mental dis-
orders, like physical disorders, differ widely both in se-
verity and in need for treatment.32,33 The fact that nearly
half the population will meet the criteria for a mental dis-
order at some time in their life does not mean that they
will all need treatment. As shown in a separate NCS-R re-
port,34 a substantial proportion of 12-month DSM-IV cases
are mild. In addition, treatments with demonstrated cost-
effectiveness are not available for all mental disorders. If
cost-effective treatments were to become available, it is
likely that anticipated resource deficits would be coun-
terbalanced at least in part by increased demand and will-
ingness to pay, consistent with reactions to recently pub-

The NCS-R age-of-onset distributions are consistent
with those reported in previous epidemiological sur-
veys25,39 in finding that anxiety disorders have the earli-
est ages of onset and mood disorders the latest. How-
ever, we are aware of no previous attempt to examine the
temporal concentration of ages of onset or to highlight
the concentration of ages of onset for most disorders in
a very narrow time span. It is also striking that the up-
per bounds of the age-of-onset IQRs for disorders with
narrow ranges are all quite young: age 15 years for im-
pulse-control disorders and anxiety disorders with nar-
row IQRs and age 27 years for substance use disorders.
These are opposite the patterns found for almost all
chronic physical disorders, with conditional risk increas-
ing with age and the upper bound of the IQR in late middle
age or old age.40 Whatever else we can say about mental
disorders, then, they are distinct from chronic physical
disorders because they have their strongest foothold in
youth, with substantially lower risk among people who
have matured out of the high-risk age range.
An important issue in assessing the societal burden
of mental disorders is whether the evidence of increas-
ing prevalence in recent cohorts is real or a methodologi-
cal artifact. The fact that NCS-R cohort effects vary in plau-
sible ways (eg, the largest ORs are associated with drug
use disorders, which are known independently to have
increased among cohorts that went through adoles-
cence beginning in the 1970s) and the fact that sociode-
mographic correlates of cohort effects are substantively
plausible (eg, the increasing similarity of women and men
with regard to substance use disorders in recent co-
horts) argue that the observed cohort effect is at least partly
due to substantive rather than methodological factors.
In addition, no evidence was found for the convergence
among cohorts with increasing age that would be ex-
pected if methodological factors were responsible for in-
tercohort variation in prevalence estimates. In addition,
we used a nonresponse survey, weighting to correct for
nonresponse bias,18 and a special age-at-onset probing
strategy to reduce recall bias6 to minimize the effects of
methodological factors on the results. Nonetheless, re-
sidual effects of methodological factors are likely, based
on the fact that longitudinal studies show that mental dis-
orders are associated with early mortality41 and the fact
that resolved mental disorders reported in baseline in-
terviews often are not reported in follow-up inter-
views.42 To the extent that these biases are at work, the
high prevalence found in the younger NCS-R cohorts
might also apply to older cohorts.
Based on the considerations in the last paragraph, we
suspect that NCS-R intercohort differences in age of on-
set are due to a combination of substantive and meth-
odological factors. A more definitive evaluation will re-
quire longitudinal trend comparisons. Even before such
data become available, though, the NCS-R results clearly
document that mental disorders are highly prevalent, that
lifetime prevalence is, if anything, underestimated, that
age-of-onset distributions for most of the disorders con-
sidered herein are concentrated in a relatively narrow age
range during the first two decades of life, and that later-
onset disorders occur in large part as temporally second-
ary comorbid conditions. To the extent that cohort ef-
fects in the data are due to methodological factors, similar
patterns might have occurred in earlier cohorts. Given
the enormous personal and societal burdens of mental
disorders, these observations should lead us to direct a
greater part of our thinking about public health inter-
ventions to the child and adolescent years and, with ap-
propriately balanced considerations of potential risks and
benefits, to focus on early interventions aimed at pre-
venting the progression of primary disorders and the on-
set of comorbid disorders.

Correction
Errors in Byline, Author Affiliations, and Acknowledg-
ment. In the Original Article titled "Lifetime Preva-
lence and Age-of-Onset Distributions of DSM-IV Disor-
ders in the National Comorbidity Survey Replication,"
published in the June issue of the ARCHIVES (2005;62:
593-602), an author's name was inadvertently omitted
from the byline and author affiliations footnote on page
592, and another author's affiliation was listed incor-
rectly. The byline should have appeared as follows: "Ron-
ald C. Kessler, PhD; Patricia Berglund, MBA; Olga Dem-
ler, MA, MS; Robert Jin, MA; Kathleen R. Merikangas,
PhD; Ellen E. Walters, MS." The author affiliations foot-
note should have appeared as follows: "Author Affilia-
tions: Department of Health Care Policy, Harvard Medi-
cal School, Boston, Mass (Dr Kessler; Mss Demler and
Walters; and Mr Jin); Institute for Social Research, Uni-
versity of Michigan, Ann Arbor (Ms Berglund); and Sec-
tion on Developmental Genetic Epidemiology, Na-
tional Institute of Mental Health, Rockville, Md (Dr
Merikangas)." On page 601, the first sentence of the ac-
knowledgment should have appeared as follows: "The
authors appreciate the helpful comments of William Ea-
ton, PhD, and Michael Von Korff, ScD." Online ver-
sions of this article on the Archives of General Psychia-
try Web site were corrected on June 10, 2005.
